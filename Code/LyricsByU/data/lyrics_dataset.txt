0,ego-remix,2009,beyonce-knowles,Pop,"Oh baby, how you doing?
You know I'm gonna cut right to the chase
Some women were made but me, myself
I like to think that I was created for a special purpose
You know, what's more special than you? You feel me
It's on baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call into work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why? Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it, I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets, you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up
Usually I'm humble, right now I don't choose
You can leave with me or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident
You decide when you find on what I'm working with
Damn I know I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet them thighs
Matter a fact it's my smile or maybe my eyes
Boy you a site to see, kind of something like me
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I got a big ego, such a huge ego
But he love my big ego, it's too much
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I can back it up, I can back it up
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up
Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, if you ain't know
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano"
1,then-tell-me,2009,beyonce-knowles,Pop,"playin' everything so easy,
it's like you seem so sure.
still your ways, you dont see
i'm not sure if they're for me.
then things come right along our way, though we didn't truly ask.
it seems as if they're gonna linger
with every delight they bring,
just like what you have truly seemed.
i'm trying to think of what you really want to say,
even through my darkest day.
you might want to leave me,
feeling strange about you
like you're gonna let me know,
when words then slipped out of you.
when words dont come so easy to say
you just leave me feeling, come what may
though i want things coming from your way.
i say to you, you bore me all the time
when you seem to hold back all in you,
all that you want to let me know.
why dont you have the courage?
speak up and i'll listen,
if you truly want me to know, then tell me.
is there something wrong with you
and you seem fastened there.
it sounds as if there'll be a melody
if things in you are let out
and then i will feel alright.
when you sleep, do you feel the same,
exactly as i do?
i really want to hear things from you,
though i've felt something new
eversince you acted that way.
if i go,
would you still mind telling me?
if i stay,
you seem to let the days go by.
if you truly want to let me know,
then tell me."
2,honesty,2009,beyonce-knowles,Pop,"If you search
For tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love
You need to live
But if you look
For truthfulness
You might just
As well be blind
It always seems to be
So hard to give
Chorus:
Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly
What I need from you
I can always
Find someone
To say
They sympathize
If I wear my heart
Out on my sleeve
But I don't want
Some pretty face
To tell me
Pretty lies
All I want
Is someone
To believe
(Chorus)
I can find a lover
I can find a friend
I can have security
Until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me
With promises again
I know, I know
When I'm deep
Inside of me
Don't be
Too concerned
I won't ask
For nothin'
While I'm gone
But when I want
Sincerity
Tell me where else
Can I turn
When
You're the one
That I depend upon
(Chorus)"

[Verse 1:]
If I wrote a book about where we stand
Then the title of my book would be ""Life with Superman""
That's how you make me feel I count you as a privilege
This love is so ideal
I'm honored to be in it
I know you feel the same I see it everyday
In all the things you do
In all the things you say
[Chorus:]
You are my rock
Baby you're the truth
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
You are my rock
You're everything I need
You are my rock
So baby rock with me
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward ya, for all the things you do
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you
Oh oh oh I
[Verse 2:]
If I were to try to count the ways
You make me smile
I'd run out of fingers
Before I run out of timeless things to talk about
Sugar you keeps it going on
Make me wanna keep my lovin strong
Make me wanna try my best
To give you what you want and what you need
Give you my whole heart, not just a little piece
More than a minimum,
I'm talking everything
More than a single wish,
I'm talking every dream
[Chorus:]
You are my rock
Baby you're the truth
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
You are my rock
You're everything I need
You are my rock
So baby rock with me
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward ya, for all the things you do
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
I wanna rock with you
[Bridge:]
If there's options I don't want them
They're not worth my time
Cause if it's not you, oh no thank you I like us just fine
You're a rock in the sand
You're a smile in a cry
You're my joy through the pain
You're the truth through the lies
No matter what I do I know that I can count on you
Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I
[Chorus:]
You are my rock
Baby you're the truth
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
You are my rock
You're everything I need
You are my rock
So baby rock with me
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward ya, for all the things you do
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you
Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night

Church bells ringing
I heard
A choir singing
I saw my love
Walk down
The aisle
On her finger
He placed a ring
Oooh, oh
I saw them
Holding hands
She was
Standing there
Wwith my man
I heard
Them promise
Til death do
Us part
Each word
Was a pain
In my heart
All I could do
All I could do
Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was
Losing the man
That I love
And all
I could do
Was cry
And now
The wedding
Is over
The rice, rice
Has been
Thrown over
Their heads
For them life
Has just begun
But mine
Is ending
Ooh
All I could do
All I could do
Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was losing
The man
That I love
And all
I could do

6,once-in-a-lifetime,2009,beyonce-knowles,Pop,"This is just another day that I would spend
Waitin' for the right one.

So get ready, (get ready) I'm ready now (get ready)

Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime
Tell me that your living in a place
Where no one else can find you.
Tell me that your sanging out my name,
Hoping that I'll hear you.
Tell me ""No"" and I'll fade away,
But this is lovin that I won't waste
So get ready, (get ready) I'm ready now (get ready)

You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore

that you gotta know
a girl will give you all of her heart

You better sit down and look around

Check my credentials
I give you everything you want, everything you need

Why don't you love me?

And why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?
I got beauty, I got class
I got style and I got ass
And you don't even care to care, looka here
I even put money in the bank account
Don't have to ask no one to help me out
You don't even notice that
Why don't you love me?

Keep my head in them books, I'm sharp
But you don't care to know I'm smart
N-n-n-n-n-no
I got moves in your bedroom
Keep you happy with the nasty things I do
But you don't seem to be in tune, ooh
Why don't you love me?

When I make me so damn easy to love?
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me

No, no, there's nothing not to love about me

Sorrow fills my eyes
But I'm not strong enough to cry

I guess I'm their soldier

Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone?
And she's crying out for help
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world?
After she saves the world
I bottle all my hurt inside
I guess I'm living a lie
Inside my mind each day I die
What can bring me back to life?
A simple word, a gesture
Someone to say you're beautiful
Come find this buried treasure
With eyes lead to a pot of gold
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone?
And she's crying out for help
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world?
After she saves the world
I've given too much of myself
And now it's driving me crazy

Sometimes I wish someone would just come here
And save me, save me from myself

We're only friends, We're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our souls
So let it show, So let it show
We can pretend, we can pretend
We only find ourselves by loosing all
Control
Nothing injured nothing gained
New horizon ready to play
with every breath you take it away
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, We're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our souls
So let it show, So let it show
We can pretend, we can pretend
We only find ourselves by loosing all

But after a while sweet love just ain't enough
So many settle for less just because
Maybe I'm more in love with what it was
But what's gets so confusing baby
You and me
It's been so much confusion lately
You couldn't see that you were losing me
Well I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company
Won't you just assume he doesn't care
To internalize it all isn't fare
So I address the problem so that he's aware
But I still feel all alone even when he's there
Maybe we can fix it baby
I know we can
If I make you miss it baby
Then maybe you will understand
That I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company

I don't see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me must be your mission
Cause with every hug and kiss you're snatching every bit of strength
That I'm gon need to fight off the inevitable
And it's a heart breaking situation I'm up in, but I can't control
[Chorus]
You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison and I just don't get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do it's a catch 22
cause the cure is found in you I don't want it but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die
[Verse 2]
You aint right take me high
Then that high it subsides
And my body flat lines
Then you come to revive
Wait wait wait I'm alive
But how long will it last
Will it all come crashing down?
How many doses am I needing now?
What's the prognosis will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down
[Chorus]
Baby you're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How can something so deadly
Feel so right
I'm not sure what to do
It's a catch 22
Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I cant lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

It's just not my body (No)
It's my mind, you don't know
How many times I told myself
This cant do (cant do)
And that I don't need you (No I don't need you)(no)
It's so unfair(fair) that I find myself right back in your care(care)
And what's good is that when you're not always there (there there)
You're no good for my health (my heath)
You're just like poison (whoa whoa whoa) (repeat)

You're just like poison

How can something so deadly

I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch 22
Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I cant lie
Baby Kiss me one more time
you're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How can something so deadly
Feel so right
I'm not sure what to do
It's a catch 22
Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it to
You're just like poison
I'm addicted, I cant lie
Kiss me one more time

Beyonce
IAM
Welcome
Welcome
Hey
Ohhhh
Beyonc - Chorus:
Welcome to a place
Where people lie to your face
Just to get it done.
Welcome to the human race
Where if you ain't got money, then you'll pay in pain
Welcome to this world of ours
And if you had the chance would you come back again ?
Cause now you're here there ain't no turning back,
You got tears in your eyes
And the monkey on your back (?)*
Akhenaton - Verse 1:
Bienvenue l o l'fort tue le faible, o la faim tue de fait
O la socit t'congratule, et t'accepte une fois la fortune faite,
O les dettes cumulent, o l'crdit accule, des tas d'foyers,
O les hommes en perte d'idaux, jurent qu'par les putes dvoyes en vido,
Chaque soir c'est la fte, les salons cossus attirent les fesses,
Sur les gros cads, qui arrosent les guridons de pure cocane,
Ici, les gosses rvent d't'Pirs, beaucoup partent et peu qui restent,
Nombreux sont ceux qui ds 13 ans connaissent leur premire ivresse,
Bienvenue l o l'air pollu, par les pots d'chappement dclenchent
Allergies en cascade, et taux record d'O3 dans les bronches,
Douleurs dans les hanches, rien plus d'dangereux qu'la faune humaine
Quand ils explosent un fourgon Brinks sans peine au Tri-Nitro-Tolune,
Les vices connus gnent la machine de l'Etat, les cabinets changent
Laissent la merde en tat, peu passent les menottes en mtal, on en est l
Ici 300 blinds font c'qui veulent, font comme s'ils vivent seuls
Ramnent tout leur p'tite gueule, quand mille meurent fauchs dans l'viseur
Bienvenue, aprs le 11 septembre on voque une aut'voie
Au silence : dis au revoir, l'enculeur d'aut'fois, dit baiser le monde haute voix
O les vieux des pays riches fantasment sur les m'mes de Bangkok
Pourquoi donc mettre part ces connards en taule
Ici on croit moins en Dieu qu'aux fant'mes, un hymne sanguinaire
On entonne, partout on sent la peur d'un peuple pass au pantone
L'hiver mange l't, et l'printemps parfois tue l'automne,
Crie Plus fort, les grands de c'monde, ont gar quelque part leur sonotone
Bienvenue, mes p'tits anges
Car voici c'monde
Beyonc - Chorus:
Welcome to a place

We all have a purpose in this world
We have to believe that we belong
Can't forget where we came from
We came from love.
Shurik'n - Verse 2:
Bienvenue dans c'truc entre enfer et paradis tant't l'un tant't l'autre.
Ange et dmon s'y disputent le parvis pour enjeu ceux qui s'y vautrent.
O l'on s'occupe de l'horreur seulement quand elle frappe nos portes.
O la rumeur tue sournoisement, vicieux coup de surin dans l'aorte.
O tu bouffes de la merde chaque jour et on te le dit qu'20 ans aprs.
Parce qu'en fait ils s'en tapent de c' qu'on pense on l'sait mais ils le diront jamais.
O on est trop con pour voir qu'un mec est bon bien avant qu'il meure
Puis on se vante de le connatre achetant ses tableaux visitant sa demeure
Bienvenue dans c'monde o on se dit tous gaux blague part l
L'caniveau l haut c'est les bureaux mais le mieux c'est au milieu
O on se sait si fragile qu'on prvoit les pices d'rechange
D'ici peu de temps on s'achtera des jambes en famille le dimanche
O tout le monde ne mange pas sa faim lieu de conflit sans fin
Crer dans le fond pour qu'un seul parvienne ses fins
La misre comme moyen o le suppos mort esclavage svit encore en divers lieux
Tu vois ! Il y a toujours des grains de poussire vaniteux qui s'prennent pour des dieux
Bienvenue pas Gattaca mais presque o seul l'lu vite la presse
On parque le reste en attendant que vieillesse se manifeste,
O on parle prslection, d'amlioration, transformation
Gntique, c'est pas magnifique une armada de super soldats de plomb
O on s'tue pour un bifteck ou un bifton
O on entend le mensonge aveugle, on voit pas l'illusion, envole la laine du mouton
Je t'annonce le sombre, parce que le clair, j'prfrerais qu'tu le dcouvre,
Allez petit ! Lance toi t'inquite fonce ! Moi, j'te couvre
Beyonc - Chorus:

Talked about, out my friends mouths
I've been beat down til He turned my life around

Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
I aint no superstar, the spotlight aint shining on me
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me

And wish I'd stayed asleep
Cause I went to bed on top of the world
Today the world's on top of me

That it breaks my heart
When I hear what they have to say about me

Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me

I'm trying my best
But it aint good enough
Shunned by the world
If I don't succeed
Cause I aint good enough
But He still loves me
If you ain't worthy just raise your hands
And let me know that you understand
That we are all so blessed to be loved, loved
Stand for him or fall for anything
Cause through his eyes we all look the same
What will we do without pain?

Ever complex in every way
And all the pieces aren't even in the box
And yet you see the picture clear as day

You catch me when I fall
Accept me, flaws and all
And that's why I love you

When I need attention I tend to nag
I'm a host of imperfection
And you see past all that
I'm a peasant by some standards
But in your eyes I'm a queen
You see potential in all my flaws
And that's exactly what I need

Doing what we like to do... our, way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's true to the heart
She rides with me - the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during ""Sex and the City""
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider, and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track mami is keepin me focused
So let's, lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and be

The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin
Now they 'bout nothin - if ever you mad about somethin
It won't be that; oh no it won't be that
I don't be at, places where we comfy at
With no be-atch; oh no you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect - nobody walkin this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin that Hermes Burkin bag,
Manolo Blahnik, Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep!

If I was your girlfried,
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you,
Even if that somebody is me

And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life

Realize all my blessings
I'm grateful To have you by my side

My heart smiles
Every time it feels so good
It hurts sometimes
Created in this world To love, to hold, To
Feel, To breathe, To love you
Dangerously in love

Dangerously,
Dangerous,
Dangerously in love with you
Oh I love you I love you I love you I love

On a bike ride every day, on the bayou

You come home from work and I jump in your arms when I saw you

I was so happy to see you, ooh

Because you loved me, I overcome, yeah
And I'm so proud of what you've become, yeah
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I make, you're there for me
You cure my disappointments
And you heal my pain
You understood my biz and you protected me
I treasure every year in place a comemory
And that's why, I want my unborn son
To be like, my daddy
I want my husband to be like, my daddy
There is no one else like, my daddy
And I thank you for lovin' me
Daddy daddy, daddy daddy
Daddy daddy, daddy daddy
Daddy daddy, daddy daddy

I still remember the expression on your face
When you found out I'd been on a date and had a boyfriend
(My first boyfriend, you shoulda seen your face)
I still remember, I called you cryin'
'Cuz of my tattoo, coulda said, ""Beyonce, I told ya so""
Instead you said you'd get one too
(You and my momma said ya'll get one just like mine)
Words can't express my boundless gratitude for you
I appreciate what you do, ohh
You've given me tight security
No matter what mistakes I know, you're there for me
You killed my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understood by biz and you protected me
I treasure every extraordinary memory, that's why
My unborn son to be like, my daddy
I want my husband to be like, my daddy
There is no one else like, my daddy
And I thank you for lovin' me
Even if my man broke my heart today
No matter how much pain I'm in, I will be okay
'Cause I got a man in my life that can't be replaced
For this love is unconditional, it won't go away
I know I'm lucky, know it ain't easy
For men who take care of their responsibilities
Love is overwhelming, Lord why did you pick me?
Can't stop my tears from falling, I love you so much daddy

Who has come here from Battle Creek.
As he walks with his Pepsi can,
He is bumped by the strangest man.
He feels no wish as he sees it roll,
Down the street to an open hole.
The taste sensation he loves so well,
Now is gone, and he starts to yell.
His Pepsi fell, he shows his lust (the joy of life)
The joy of life he needs it anyhow (the joy of life, the joy of taste)
He makes the sound of a tender bear (the joy of Pepsi)
As the crowd around him starts to swell.
Sir, a Pepsi please (the joy of life)
And they pack a Pepsi onto Zeke,
The Pepsi's found, the people cheer (the taste of Pepsi)
For the joy of Pepsi now is here!

But that nigga came running back

And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears

We teach girls to shrink themselves
To make themselves smaller
We say to girls
""You can have ambition
But not too much
You should aim to be successful
But not too successful
Otherwise you will threaten the man""
Because I am female
I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind that
Marriage is the most important
Now marriage can be a source of
Joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls to each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments
Which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings
In the way that boys are
Feminist: the person who believes in the social
Political, and economic equality of the sexes

We be all night, and everything alright
No complaints for my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking, walking in my l'assemblage
I'm grubbing on it, gru-gru-grubbing, if you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinking, keep my brain right
I'm on the brown, yeah, gangster wife
New sheets, he sweat it out, like wash rags, he wet it out
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic 'til my voice hoarse
Then I fill the tub up halfway, then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that big body Benz serving all of this, swerv, surfing all of this good, good

106,encore-for-the-fans-bonus-track,2006,beyonce-knowles,Pop,"I wanted to give all of my fans something extra
Because this album was so special to me
And it came so effortlessly after I finished
The film of my life 'Dreamgirls'
Because I was so inspired by Deena
I wrote songs that were saying all the things
I wish she woulda said in the film
And I wanted to give you an extra special song
That Deena sings, it's a pivotal moment
When Deena finally does get the strength to stand up for herself
And does know who she is, and knows what she wants
I'm sure all of you women can relate to the lyrics
This is Listen"

The more you make me see
By giving me all you've got (tell me more)

Over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
When all the while inside
I knew it was real
The way you make me feel
Lying here next to you
Time just seems to fly
Needing you more and more
Let's give love a try (let's give love a try)
Sweeter than sweeter love grows
And heaven's there for those
Who fool the tricks of time
With hearts in love will find
True love in a special way
The closer I get to you, baby
The more you make me see (the more you make me see)
By giving me what you've got
Your love captured me
Over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
When all the while inside
I knew this was real (got to be real)
The way you make me feel (you know, you know, you know)
My baby, my baby, my baby, my love, my love, my love, my love
(Come closer love) Come a little closer so that we can see into the eyes of love
I wanna see into those eyes of love
(Come closer love) Just a little a closer let me speak to you
I want to softly tell you something
Here I am, here's my love; I just want you to come closer
Come a little closer, let me whisper in your ear
'Cause I want to tell you something
I wanna whisper in your ear so soft, so come closer love
Move on in real close so we can celebrate the way we feel about each other's lovin'
Wanna tell you words, words of love, words that make you wanna"

Always running the streets
He's playing the game
And he'll never love me
You say that he's fake
But why does it feel so real

They call shots I call audibles
Jacob the jeweler, Bubbles Loraine Schwartz sorta dude
It's big ballin' baby when I'm caught in u
I'm talking spa bags and fly pads and rooms at the Bloomberg
And rumors u on the verge of a new marriage
'Cuz that rock on ur finger's like a tumor
U can't fit ur hand in ur new purse
It's humorous to me they watchin' and we just yachtin'
Island hoppin' off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso, Hov baby u ever seen saturn?
No, not the car, but everywhere we are
U sure to see stars, this is high level not eye level
My bezzle courtesy of Audemars
I'll order urs tomorrow now look at the time I saved u
Mama let me upgrade u
Just when u think u had it all
Big ends, car notes, collectin' cars
Picture ur life have a baby with me
Make u my project, celebrity
I'll keep ur name hot in the streets
It's the little glimpse of light
That makes the diamond really shine
And u already is a star but unless ur flawless
Then ur dynasty ain't complete without a chief like me

I wanted more than just a man, I needed a friend
Someone I can talk to, someone who really listens
When you touched my hand, the sun got brighter then
Trusting you, I closed my eyes and felt our love begin

Heaven shined on us it was the summertime
Baby, there is nothing like the summertime, summertime
Now its been a year and were closer
Fall in love again when I hold ya
I know that God set you aside for me
And now you are my prize
Wanna grow old witcha
And fill our house with your pictures
Have a son for you, a little girl for me
Together well raise a family

I'm wishing on the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow rain never comes
And I'm wishing on all of the things we never done
I never thought I'd see the time when you would be
So far away from home
So far away from me
Just think of all the moments that we spent
I just can't let you go from me, we were meant
I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know
In the game of love, you reap what you sow
(Sow)
I feel it's time we should make up baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh baby
When we're together whether or never

I feel, it's time for us to get back together

Hoping on the days of loving, loving you so

You're the one that's got it twisted cause I'm right by your side
I had a bad day you jumpin' on my back for a ride
What can a man say I'm on the run, just for your auditionin
Callin on you every night it's like you never listenin

You're the one that's switchin up gettin to specifics
When you say that I'm just dreamin I be rollin like a Misholin (?)

Carmen you just trippin cause you know I love you infinite
Just so we could be here look at everything I did for this

So why you actin like that
You don't have to take it anymore fight back

Trying to be a star and now you messin up my cosmo

I can't believe I believed
Everything we had would last

She was from your past
Silly of me to dream of
One day having your kids
Love is so blind
It feels right when its wrong
I can't believe I fell for four years
I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me
You're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete
When you cheat with loose women
It took me some time but now I've moved on
'Cause I realized I got
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry

And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now

Your so controlling, you say that you love me
But you don't
Your family told me one day
I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing
With your three kids in my home
Love is so blind it feels right when its wrong
Now that its over
Stop calling me
Come pick up yo clothes
No need to front like ya still wit me
All your homies know
Even your very best friend
Tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time
But now I am strong

I only give you a hard time

I've been cryin' for too long
What did you do to me?
I used to be so strong
But now you took my soul
I'm cryin', can't stop cryin'
Can't stop cryin'
You could've told me that you wasn't happy

I've been beat down til He turned my life around

Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
I aint no superstar, the spotlight aint shining on me
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me

And wish I'd stayed asleep
Cause I went to bed on top of the world
Today the world's on top of me
Now everybody's got opinions
They ain't been in my position
That it breaks my heart
When I hear what they have to say about me

I aint no superstar, the spotlight aint shining on me
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
And I'm not perfect
Yes I do wrong
I'm trying my best
But it aint good enough
Shunned by the world
If I don't succeed
Cause I aint good enough
But He still loves me
If you ain't worthy just raise your hands
And let me know that you understand
That we are all so blessed to be loved, loved
Stand for him or fall for anything
Cause through his eyes we all look the same
What will we do without pain?

I was sittin on my couch
You was really buggin' so I
Told you to get out
I had been misjudging you
You had a lotta nerve, you
Too damn old to be so immature, I hope you learn
You said I move too slow, I
I showed you to the door
You said you'd call me later
I said don't call no more
It is cool if you can't wait for me
I'm glad you let me know

But they lost, cause my game made them forfeit
Slicker than a porpis and thicker than a horses
Carmen Brown got the whole town speechless
I'll stick to my thesis, I'll stick to my features
Brothas trying to hold, but thier game never reaches
Most of these cats are like the middle of peaches
I see you looking at, but what you looking at?
You in a bar, wanna twist me like a bottle cap
Mos Def - I'm trying to holla Miss, to see if you gonna holla back
Beyonce' - Your game is whack, and know you will not get your quarter back
See this is Carmen, curves like a cul-de-sac
skin coffee and cream, your donuts, you ain't dunkin that

Sarpong - And I'm the thag
Mos Def - Mel Gibson
Sarpong - Danny Gloverin'
Beyonce' - But I'm not hearing you, you might as well be mumbling
See, I have dreams with a man, what will become of him?
There's not a kid out here who can make me believe
I should post pone my goals, he got tricks up his sleeve?
Whole bar full of cuffs and you ain't locking me down
Mos Def - I got a warrant for ya heart and a bedroom and trial

Hold ya thighs, raise 'em high and daddy long stroke you

Take my gun out the holster, I still got the Barretta
Beyonce' - Brothas sweat Carmen like Patrick Ewing, but that kid...
Mos Def - Don't waste your time, he ain't no doing, he's just a Sergeant
Passing out tickets for parking
Sarpong - Chickenheads clucking
Beyonce' - Pitiful bulls barking
See this is Carmen, voice sweet as marvin
I turn out lights, with the switch, when I'm walking
Girls getting jealous, cause they man always hawking
Even got Lou looking at me like he stalking
And I got a mind too
I wouldn't bless you,
if your first name was ""Hachu"" on Sunday singing gospel
Mos Def - You ain't a dime, just a nickel acting hostel

Someone I can talk to, someone who really listens

Trusting you, I closed my eyes and felt our love begin

Now its been a year and were closer
Fall in love again when I hold ya

And now you are my prize
Wanna grow old witcha
And fill our house with your pictures

Yeah, open our mind as we cast away oppression
Yeah, open the streets and watch our beliefs

It's just floating in the air, lookie there

Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me

You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought

Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me I just melt away
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear (They say love hurts)

Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it after fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first

And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here

And know that I meant something in somebody's life
The hearts I have touched will be the proof that I leave
That I made a difference, and this world will see
I was here

Baby lemme put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody cuz
It's bout to go down
Imma take this time
To show you how much you mean to me
Cuz you all I need
No money can emphasize or describe
The love that's in between the lines
Boy look into my eyes
While I'm grinding on you
This is beyond sex
I'm high on you
If it's real then you know how I feel
Rockin on you babe
Rockin rockin on you babe
Swirlin on you babe
In my mind all I can think about
Is a frame for our future
And the pictures of the past
And a chance to make this love last
(Chorus)
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body

Baby lemme put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody cuz

Never thought that we could become someone else's hero.
Man we were just in the food court eating guy gyros.
Yesterday that's the way,
Every single morning I try to pray!
Grandmama nem they never forgot, nothing else really means nothing to me.
I ain't stunting to be.
Talking to me?
Girl, why you fucking with me?
Move on, there

Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring, all these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels, I'm touring

So where's my money
I know you bet
I'd never make that move
So why's the house empty?
Light's off by the end of this week
I'll leave with what I came with baby
I'll take the dogs, you keep the mercedes
Cause I'm gone, I'm not fazed
I walk these roads with grace
And I'll wave with you behind me
With a new smile on my face
Cause I'm walking in new shoes now
I got a new song to sing
When I walk in the room every head turns
Every eye is on me
To bad you're not here to see it
And by the time you get this
I'll be so long gone and far
I'll send you a postcard
Aha I'll send you a postcard
Hey baby
You seen a ghost? this ain't yo lady
This is the chick that you held back now
All of the things you've said were crazy
I checked out my list and I feel good about it
I got the new haircut
The one that you said wouldn't look no good
Took that job you said I could not get
Wore that dress you said I'd never fit in"

Kick him out, kick him out, kick him out, kick him out"

Will it give me some light?
Should I wait for you to call? Is there any hope at all?
Are you drifting by?
When I think about it I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it the less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here and then
You disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
And then I lie all by myself, I see your face, I hear your voice
My heart stays faithful
And time has come and time has passed, if it's good, it's got to last
It feels so right
When I think about it I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it the less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here and then
You disappear

You disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You, you disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear
I missed all the signs one at a time
You were ready
What did I know starting our lives
No, my love I'm ready to show
When I think about it I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it the less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here and then
You disappear, you disappear

You don't need to call into work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why? Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it, I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets, you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough

He got a big ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up
Usually I'm humble, right now I don't choose
You can leave with me or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident
You decide when you find on what I'm working with
Damn I know I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet them thighs
Matter a fact it's my smile or maybe my eyes
Boy you a sight to see, kind of something like me

It's too strong, it won't fit

He got a big ego, such a huge ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much

Out in the darkness with no guide
I know the cost of a losing hand
Never thought the grace of God, go High
I found heaven on earth
You were my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria
I've been alone when I'm surrounded by friends
How could the silence be so loud?
But I still go home knowing that I've got you
There's only us when the lights go down
You are my heaven on earth
You are my hunger, my thirst
I always hear this voice inside
saying Ave Maria
Sometimes love can come and pass you by
While you're busy making plans
Suddenly hits you and then you realize
It's out of your hands, baby you got to understand
You are my heaven on earth
You are my last, my first

And say a prayer

I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart""

You took that ring off

Took that ring off

Rolling through the hood to find the boys kick dust and cuss crank up some noise
Police on my drawers, I have to pause
40 ounce in my lap and it's freezing my balls
Hook a right turn and let the boys go past
Then I say to myself, They can kiss my ass
Hip to get drunk got the 8 in my lips

Stepped on yo foot, cold dissed yo ho,
Asked her to dance and she said ""Hell, no""
Called her a bitch, cos that's the rule,
Boys in the hood tryin to keep me cool.
Tell me, homeboy, you wanna kick my butt?
I walked in your face and we get em up.

Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that GTA
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
Down on B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JB is on freebase
The boy JB was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge

Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellows out there, makin' that dollar
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'
Left to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control
Then wrapped the six-fo' round the telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another""
Walkin home and I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Kat got beat for resistin arrest

Album: Ghetto Dope
Song: Pass Me Da Green
Typed by: burn1ing@aol.com
This is a ghetto public announcement (weed smokers)
Roll your blunts tight
And light your joints
Inhale...slowly exhale
And that's how you get high.
(clip from Friday)
I know you don't smoke weed... I know this
But I'm gonna get you high today
Cause it's Friday, you ain't got no job, and you ain't got shit to do
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy {*repeat 8X*}
(Inhale....exhale) Eyes selling red, got my dank from the Bahamas
Went to see my girl smoke some green with her mama
Jumped in my Cutlass on the way to the liquor store
Picked up some blunts, got ten on the 2-0
Fix these palm trees wit some green leaves
Got a nigga's head spinning like the seven seas
Puff, puff, pass, nigga that's what Simon say
Fools that hog the green or da weed gonna get carried away
Fingernails burnt, lookin like a tweeker
Ears steadily poppin, but not from the speakers
Green got me hungry, fiendin for them munchies
cause real smokers don't blow no fuckin green on empty stomachs
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy {*repeat 4X*}
Green trees pack wood, make cabbage
I like to get high but it ain't a bad habit
Speed up with that weed smoke comin out my 'llac
Got a hottie in the front and one in the back
Blowin shotguns to me and my homie
I feel like this weed make a young nigga horny
I stopped the fuckin lac at Holiday Inn
I ain't even trippin, told the girls to come in
Laid her down steady cause she know I'm ready
Choppin up weed like motherfuckin spaghetti
Hoes down south must know voodoo
cause every time I hit the weed I'm lookin for Isuzus
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy {*repeat 5X*}
Y'all high yet?
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy {*repeat 3X*}
Damn nigga y'all chokin, get the fuck out of here nigga
Pass me da green I need some weed with my Hennessy
Nigga I said are y'all high yet?
Pass me da green I need some weed with my Hennessy {*repeat 3X*}
Oh, you think you trippin now huh?
You thinkin you hearing voices nigga?
Well, if you is then you high nigga, but if you ain't"
257,trust-no-bitch,2007,eazy-e,Hip-Hop,"Yes Im too smart to get dicked...or so the case may be
that's how the ho felt when she found at that she couldnt play me
I know the game and I know it rather swell too
Rubbin up on my dick and givin me hints that your interested
thinking first you'll kiss my lips and rub my hips, then he'll take a sip
of hennesey hit the buddha, pass out and i'll take his shit
HELL NAW monkey mouth trick, ya stupid ho
you must be a fool if you thinking that i dunno
But nah you broke ass hoes wanna come up, shaking that money maker
but i break her 'cause the bitch is a faker
Or maybe she just dont know the formula
of how to get rich quick
without making happy dicks
That's all the bitch know is...
how to be a mega ho
i guess that just goes to show
that's she too ignorant to know
that i wont be played...or gay or dapper, but I aint perfect
I whip the dick out now and then and let em slurp it
but im careful, bein aware of the bitches
thats torchin niggas on purpose 'cause they think they deserve it
yea thats some cold shit, my experience oughta learn ya
that if a nigga aint tryina smoke you a bitch tryina burn ya
So trust no
*Chorus*
Trust no... bitch (?funky cut? bitches)
Trust no... bitch (?funky cut? ho)
x2
(AMG)
I refuse to lose so I chose few and trust none
To my women I love, but to you bitches I aint the one
When i tell you to trust no bitch, It might not occur to you
females aint the only bitches that Im refering to
See you can help a bitch
let alone treat swell a bitch
'cause the bitch sold out...gon sell out...or the bitch gon snitch
Bitches wanna be and gonna always be around
Watchin what ya doin tryina use ya and keep ya down
bore ya with a story ya got ya own
Imma strengthn your conviction to give that dog a bone
And move on...for the motherfucker fakin you... fuck you
and make you take their punk bitch ass to the bank foo
see bitches get paid. these bitches got charms
I see em at the mall, on tv and on my homies arms
Just some of homies got bitches but we breaking bitches
so i come like dis bitch ""act like you know me
*Chorus*
Eazy E the muthafuckin manipulator when it comes to pussy, hoes
just watch how my dick grows
but since all hoes fall in the bitch category,
trustin no hooker ass bitch is mandatory
how much do you want? bitch how much can you take
'cause a nigga like the E you cant break
Put ya skinny little ass in my face and I'll slap it
Whip out my dick and let you lick before i tap it
My left hands on your ass my right hands on your head
'cause bitches get the nut.... and niggas get the lead
suckin my dick lickin my balls you know you are the master
suckin my toes lickin my ass you make me come faster
But it just dont stop
suckin everybodies dick...'cause its good to the last drop
but that shit dont faze me
I trust no car wrecking ho's this ones for you tracy
*Chorus*
Bitches aint nuffin but a hole in a 9 deuce
I'd rather make a mil while sippin a cold brew
Bitches aint shit...word to the digi-digi-dick
Eazy E PPC AMG and Quik
Bitch I aint babyface so save ya whip appeal
I neva go on dates with broke bitches, 'cause free meals
are suppose to pay the way to lucrative panty deals?
Bitch please, you betta hit ya knees
and you can even touch ya toes
'cause im still playin yall punk hoes like dominios
and if you suck the dick right and the pussy tight
I might not beat you down til the 2nd nite
Once a dog always a dog, trick
ya little trick tramp slut with a big butt
'cause you aint shit bitch
I'd rather fuck ya then love ya
'cause bitch I neva trust ya

Me and my homies we tighter than a glove
Chop a lot of game as how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
Cuz we kick much ass at the Playaz Club
I got a hoe named Real de Real
She got a buddy named SP-12 now you know the deal
We getz freaky in the studio late night
That's why the beats that you hear are comin real tight
Somethin to roll to somethin to stroll to
use a playa in the game this will hold you
Mo money mo money for the bank roll
Stick to the script don't slip in the nine-fo
A lot of fools put salt in the game
Till these women get the notion that they runnin the game huh
I run my own and I'm my own self person
No respect make the situation worse then
Fillmoe, H.P., and Sunnydale
There's a playaz club every one you dwell
Lakeview, P.H., and Army Street
A different part of town a different kind of freak
I just wiggle my toes on a mink rug
press play on the remote at the playaz club
(chorus)
(more champagne, Mr. Forte?)
From day one I had to get my money right
Me, Fly, and Franky J we took a airplane flight huh
They wanted to hear a rap I said alright bet
We dropped the beat and grabbed the mic then they wrote a check
A few G's for the pocket no hesitation
Took a flight back to the Golden State and
Shops made orders from a whole new capital
Words get now 4-Tay's out rappable
Don't need a Glock but I bought one just in case
Suckas try to stop me from pursuin my paper chase
Cuz the chase is on because it don't stop
I got the beat and got the rap you make the Glock pop
So treacherous suckas couldn't sweat this on a bad day
By the way just in case you never heard
Rappin 4-Tay I'm on the smooth tip
Never trippin off them suckas poppin off the lip
I pop the top off the drank and we can roll some dank bro
Leave the gat at the house bring some dominoes
Take off your shoes relax and get a body rub
And shoot your mackin at these women at the playaz club
(chorus)
You can't resist it but don't get it twisted
V.I.P. that means the number's not listed
Membership is based on clout and how you carry yourself
Now homie what you all about?
I stack paper and kick it with the O.G's
Some got a nine-to-five some drink a lot of keys
You can learn a whole lot from a playa
Lot of these playas make a damn good rhyme sayer
A lot of people get a misconception
And start driftin in the wrong direction
Miss goody two sure see you later
I ain't got time you ain't nuthin but a playa hater
I'd rather kick it with the crew in Arizona
They chop game like we do in California
Another show another flow a new bank account
But cash money comes in large amounts
So get your membership but never slip to lame fast
Or else us and fly will have to tap that ass
And drop you to the ground and make your knees scrub
It's just an everyday thang at the playaz club
(chorus)
Me and my homies we tighter than a glove
Chop a lot of game is how we do it at the playaz club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
Cuz we kick much ass at the Sucka Free club
(4-Tay talking)
Yeah I'd like to send this shout out
to all the playaz club throughout the world
I know they got a Playaz club out there in Chicago
(Fly)
What about that one they got out there in Philly, Fo?
(4-Tay)
You know they got one out there in Atlanta the way they by choppin
(Fly)
Shit, Detroit, New York, Texas

Yeah but we gonna move on down to these

Hey yo Dr. here's another proper track and it's phat
Watch the sniper, time to pay the piper
And let the real shit provoke
See you's a wanna be loc and you get smoked and I hope that your
Fans understand when you talk about preyin' me
The same records that your makin' is payin' me
Muthafuck Dre, Muthafuck Snoop, Muthafuck Death Row
Yo and here comes my left blow
'Cause I'm the E-A-Z-Y-E and this is the season
To let the real Muthaphuckkin G's in
You're like a kid you find the poop when you open up your diaper
But tell me where the fuck you find that anorexic rapper
Talkin' about who you go squabble with and who you shoot
You're only 60 pounds when you're wet and wearin' boots

Damn E they tried to fade you on Dre Day
But Dre Day only make Eazy's payday

So nigga please, nigga please, don't step to these
Muthaphuckkin Real G's
[Gangsta Dresta]
Every day it's a new rapper
Claimin' to be deffer than the Dresta
Smoother than a bitch, but betray the role of gangster
Ain't broke a law in your life, yet every time you rap you yap about the guns and knives, just take a good look at the Nigga
And you'll capture the fact that
the bastard is simply just an actor
Who mastered the bang and the slang and the mental
Of niggas in Compton, Watts, and South Central
Never ever once have ya ran with the turf
But yet in every verse claim ya used to do the dirt
But tell me who's a witness to ya fuckin' work
See ya never had no business so save the drama, jerk
Niggas straight kill me knowin' that they pranksters
This is goin' out to you studio gangsters
See I did dirt but put in work and many niggas can vouch that
So since I've got stripes I got the right to rap about that
But niggas like you, I gotta hate ya
Cause I'm just tired of so many niggas
Claiming that they come from projects
Knowin' you ain't seen no parts of the streets G
Think ya started trying to bang a rap
While ya tryin' to sign a peace treaty
Wearing khakis and mime while you rhyme
Little fag try to sag, but ya floodin' at the same time
And ya set don't accept ya, Scared to kick it with your homies
Cause ya know they don't respect ya
So nigga please check nuts before you step to these
Muthaphuckkin Real G'z

Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are fuckin' actors
Pranksters, studio gangsters, busters
but this time you're dealing with some real muthafuckas
jeez, nigga please, don't try to step cause if you do
Then a peeled cap is all that would be left
See young niggas like me will break you of something
Claiming my city but Dre you ain't from Compton
Niggas like ya'll is what I call wannabes
And ain't shit compared to Real Muthaphuckkin G's
[Eazy-E]
I never met an OG who never did shit wrong
Ya tried to diss the Eazy-E so now nigga it's on
You and your Doggy Dogg think that you're hogging shit
Both of you bitches can come and suck my doggy dick
Beatin' up a bitch don't make you shit
But then again some niggas think it makes a man. . . Damn
It's a trip how a nigga could switch so quick
From wearing lipstick to smoking on chronic at picnics
And now ya think your bigger, but to me you ain't nothin'
but a bitch ass nigga
That ain't worth a food stamp
And at Death Row I hear you're getting treated like boot camp
Gotta follow your sergeant's directions
Or get your ass popped with the Smith & Wesson
Learn a lesson from the Eaze
Stay in your place and don't step to REAL MUTHAPHUCKKIN G'Z

Comin through with a big lick for '94
Showin alla y'all them true-ass gangsta flows
So bow-wow bow-wow the big dog's in town
and them guts is the only thing a nigga pound
Laid back as I blow a fat sack
Hittin switches for them bitches, hittin corners in a Cadillac
So take a ride on tha ruthless side
with the E to the A-Z-why
That nigga makin more off yo hits than you do
you fools, need to recognize this crew when I roll through
Tryin to speak up on tha OG, nigga you don't know me
Break em off these nuts lil want to-be
Cause I peel caps if need be
And ain't nothin you gonna bring don't see me
Just tah let you know...
Chorus: repeat 2X

Comin from the see-O-M-P-T-O-N

Verse Two:
It's the E comin up from the gank
so nigga let me ride all the way to the bank
Coz ain't nuthin on my mind but the gips
Gotta have a grip, run a nigga dip
Back to the pass on the Compton streetz
Where the niggaz get beat when us gangstas meet
And fools gettin mad coz they can't ride like I ride
Front n back, dippin side to side
And it's been like that since I was a BG
""It's the E,"" that's what they scream when they see me
Mama said every day is like this
Fools screamin that I put em in a twist
Thought you had it bad, isn't really all good
If the homies only knew in the hood
That you was gettin done like a two dollar hoe
It's just a lil something from the E tah let you know...
Chorus
Verse Three:
It's still the see-P-T, nuthin more, nuthin less
On a quest to put that bomb in my chest
Coz them busta-ass niggaz can't see what I'm sayin
They think the E be playin [What ?]
But I ain't givin up nuthin but this glock in yo mouth
So recognize that and get yo punk ass knocked out
So if you want to ride nigga jump on in
Sip a cup o' gin. Ain't no friends when it come to ends
So no hard feelings when you niggaz be dealin

Coz the only thing poppin is a snaps
and ain't no fun when a nigga be tap perhaps

I gotta get drunk before the day begins
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride
I got front back and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin' new shit by NWA
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this
Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that GTA
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
Down on B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JB is on freebase
The boy JB was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellows out there, makin' that dollar
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'
Left to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control
Then wrapped the six-fo' round the telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another""
Walkin home and I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Kat got beat for resistin arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is cut for doin the crime
For defense on the boy, he'll do some time
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellaz start to riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork
""Disruption of the court"", said the judge
On a six year sentence my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in

He yelled out ""fire!"", then came Suzi

Louie...I'm sorry Louie...hahaha...]
[Bashed his head in with my Louieville slugger]
(5x)
I knew this muthaphukka named Louie
Every day the nigga talk shit but today he tried to do me
He rolled down my block with a pistol and a stare
a black khaki suit and dooky brades in his hair
The muthaphukka think I'm slippin
But I got my gat and a 40 and I'm sippin
Waitin for the fool to get out the car
The stupid muthaphukka thinks I'm a star
But I'm not, I'm the type that kick the niggaz ass
Fast ! Eazy E's a nigga that'll blast
Hold up, wait, the nigga started to load his gat
I grabbed my bat and ran around the back yo
He's at my window, thinkin I'm playin Nintendo
But the stupid nigga don't know I'm behind him so
he dropped the gat like a stupid muthaphukka
So I bashed his head in with my Louieville slugger
[CHORUS:]
[Bashed his head in with my Louieville slugger]

I knew this bitch named Wheaches
She often want me to fuck her happy ass on the beaches
But [?? huh ??] yo peaches be fuckin around with me
instead o' fuckin her man
She's butt-naked with my dick in her hand, yo
As soon as Wheaches started suckin, I saw this muthaphukkin
nigga behind the car, and he was duckin
So I told the bitch to hold on [Hold on]
You stupid bitch, put yo muthaphukkin clothes on
I wonder if this nigga's tryin a jack me
Coz I ain't got my gat with me
Shit, the nigga started runnin up fast
I thought he was gonna blast, so I hid behind her ass
She started howlin out ""wait"", I banked her in the face
But the punk nigga pulled out [?? mace ??]
He asked the stupid bitch did I mug her
So I bashed his head in with my Louieville slugger
[CHORUS]
I'm a muthaphukkin psycho and I don't give a fuck about'em
I kill the nigga and cut off his dick, so you know I got'em
coz [?? huh ??] ate his brain, left the nigga for dead
Now it's a gallon of blood, drippin from under his bed
[Oh, no ! What happened to my lover ???]
Bitch I bashed his head in with my Louieville slugger
Bitch tried to call the cops, fuck that
I gotta take the girl out with my muthaphukkin bat
Coz I ain't doin 10 in the pen
for a bitch and her dead-ass boyfriend
So...I gotta kill the ho
I'm reachin for my weapon slow
That's when I notice some nigga standin by the door
The little nigga sayin ""don't kill my mother"", so
I bashed his head in with my Louieville slugger

Fuck my baby'z mama 'coz she's the type o' bitch
That wanna see me broke, broker than a joke, bitch stole my role

The low life Compton shoppin' swap me trick
I wanna kill the ho then slam her in the trunk of my six fo'
'Coz yo, that ho made my dick grow and now her lawyer's at every show
Waitin' for me to kick in my dough

And I'm not the one, I should just knock her punk ass out
While I'm in court payin' child support
But then I gotta deal with the father and the steel
And he's the type o' nigga that a nigga's gotta kill
Make me kick up a grip, I don't like her
'Coz the bitch is buyin skirts instead of diapers
Beggin' so much to hold hands it's startin to look like cuffs
I wish I never fucked but now it's too late
How much you made? 'Coz accordin' to your income
You might have to spend some time behind bars
Now ya find it hard
Never thought a bitch would pull a stunt like this
I can't do another day with Pamela
So I'm a pay ya, Anna but I just like to say

I used to be an employer
But now I'm just an employee filin' bankruptcy
But now the punk bitch can't touch me
Huh, I only call her to check up on my daughter
So now she's got a restraining order
Put me to the curb and had the nerve to ask a bower or dime
Bitch, you must be outcha rabid ass mind
Huh, love for start will take much, you see, the bitch broke me
So now I need a crutch
But you gotta understand a judge don't give a fuck
About a young nigga that's down on his luck

And give the bitch back her drawers
So if ya drivin' by and ya see her
Do me favor, give the bitch the finger, fuck her

Dick the niggas corps leave it on his momma's porch
Don't give a fuck about shit that's why I mellow
Or maybe it's the fact that I'm kin to the devil
A psychopathic nigga that's always quick to fill a
Nigga for a cause I'm a muthafuckin killer
Thriller from manilla though I'm shown as the average
Try to test your luck and get bucked by a muthafuckin savage
I got my niggas from gravestreet watts

I got my niggas all across the muthafuckin land
That's down with the e-a-z-why e
Now, later on that night as I'm rollin
Lookin for a nigga I can gat and pack a hole in
Stoppin at a light on the latenight
Fire up a phillie blunt to get my head right
See some niggas slippin at a burger stand
And in my mind all I'm thinkin is a murder plan
Creepin through the drive through kinda slow
I got my hot beams on the back of the .4
Yo , smokin on chronic with the rag down
Not knowin I'm about to lay their ass down
Reach for them fools make my move
Leaned out my jeep and I creep kinda smooth
With the gat to the nigga's dome now he's sleeps
One shot to the top body flopped on the seat
Peep , I dumped on the lil' skinny passenger
A bitch is screamin in a rage so I blasted her
Smashed and I got about 5 blocks
Before I got stopped by punk ass cops

YEAH!
Black niggaaaaaaaaaa
YEAH!
Killa killa killa killa
Black nigga killa hate brought death
Around the block as I holler points bust though the punks back
Raising gang, feel no pain, as I penetrate
Niggas fly deep as I strike a quick pace
I got the evil of a dead nigga trapped in my mind
So my soul is a threat to my mankind
Born to kill I'm wicked by nature
Cause the streets of my neighborhood breath young hell razors
I'm 30 odd 6 with the skill
I make a skinhead brain bust all across the West Coast
Motherfuckers catchin heat
As I bring anger
And release more danger from my chamber
The evil in my blood is possessed
So I creep low from the back slow and puts led in that nigga's flesh
Ain't no hope, every nigga wants to be the nine milla on the trigga
The black nigga killa
(Chorus X4)
Deep from the death as I crept
I can feel his glock in the back of my neck
I'm thinkin to myself what the fuck as I pause
I can feel my heart thumpin from my balls
Up against his gun what the fuck could I do?
If I make a wrong move, the nigga might shoot
My pops always warned me when I was comin up
If I play pussy, I'm bound to get fucked
Though bein broke as hell it be drivin me crazy
Hooked up with my niggas start jackin niggas daily
Fat sacks of dirt, to Dayton's, I got em
Slang em dirt cheap cause everything was profit
Now I got his nine on the back of my mind
As I watch my life pass right before my eyes
The shit that I done, is all in my face
Reflections of death as I step with my 38
The black nigga killa
(Chorus X4)
Which bitch made the statement?
About the nigga bustin caps supportin all black Ben Davis
I'm out the doe
My pager's blowin up I check my ghat twice
Cause niggas like to jack on a late night
And as I'm livin like a criminal
I try my best to keep my gang tight and stay away from punk niggas
Strikin down Broadway
I caught some niggas out of bounds from the (pause) upper MLK
Slowly crept from the cut at a quick pace
Ain't no love in my heart all I feel is hate
So 25 with that L might be mando
Cause nigga I'm killin for them gold things with that Zapco
I watch the terror in eyes as he backed up
Ease of the break pop that clutch and watch his chest bust
Wide open as I bounce in the night quicker
From the nine milla trigga
The black nigga killa

So don't get me twisted
Cause in some pussy is the place to be
Always fuckin' is the life for me
Spread them legs open far and wide
Fuck this shit just let me put my dick inside, so
Gimme that that that nut

291,boyz-n-tha-hood-g-mix,2006,eazy-e,Hip-Hop,"Aiyo, man you remember that shit eazy did a while back
Muthafuckaz said wasnt gonna work (that crazy shit)
Stupid shit man, aiyo eazy
Why dont you come out from the piano
And bust this crazy shit
Woke up quick, at about noon
Jus' thought that I had to be in compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begins
Before my mother starts bitchin' about ma friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggaz at the path throwin' up gang signs
Ran in the house, and grabbed ma clip
Wit the mack 10 on the side of ma hip
Bailed outside and pointed ma weapon
Just as I thought the fools kept steppin'
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on ma ride
I got front back, and side to side
Then I let the alpine play (play)
Pumpin' new shit by nwa
It was gangsta gangsta at the top of the list
Then I played my own shit and it went somethin' like this
Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo''
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold, shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be
A fresh el camino rollin' kilo g
He rolled down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that g.t.a.
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash, we'll pull ya card
Knowin' nutin' in life but to be legit'
Don't quote me boy 'Cause I ain't said shit
Yo man
""get the fuck out""
[Scratches] pump that beat
Muthafucka, say what
Down on b's is the place to give me the pace
He said ma man j.d. is on freebase
The boy j.d. was a friend of mine
'Till I caught him in my car tryin' to steal the alpine
Chased him down the street to call a truce
The silly muthafucka pulls out a deuce deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 guage
One sucker dead, l.a. times front page
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash, well pull ya card
Knowin' nutin' in life but to be legit'
Don't quote me boy 'Cause I ain't said shit
""Yo leroy""
""Beer drinkin' breath stinkin' sniffin' glue""
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where ma homeboys chill
The fellas out there makin' dat dollar
I pulled up in ma 6 fo' impala
They greet me wit a 40 and I start drinkin'
And from the 8 ball, my breath starts stinkin'
Left to get ma girl to rock that body
Before I left, I hit the bac-ardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe said somethin' that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy-ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know
Reached back like a pimp, slapped the hoe
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right cross and knocked his old-ass out
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash, well pull ya card
Knowin' nutin' in life but to be legit'
Don't quote me boy 'Cause I ain't said shit
""Who do u think you are Mr. big stuff""
""Rock this muthafucka like the hard 3 tha hard way""
I'm rollin' hard, now under control
Then wrapped the 6 fo' round a telephone pole
I looked at ma car and I said ""oh brother""
I'll throw it in the gutter and go buy another
Walkin' home and I seen the g ride
Now cat is drivin', kilo on the side
As they busted a u, they got pulled over
A undercover cop in a dark green nova
Cat got beat for resistin' arrest
He socked a pig in the head for rippin' his guess
Now g is caught, for doin' the crime
Fourth offense on the boy, he'll do some time
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash, well pull ya card
Knowin' nutin' in life but to be legit'
Don't quote me boy 'cause I ain't said shit
L.a. playa
Big drum beater
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellas 'caused a riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo g on trial cold cut a fart
Obstruction of the court said the judge
On a six year sentence, ma man didn't budge
Baliff came over to turn him in
Kilo g looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out fire, then came Suzie
The bitch came in with a sub-machine uzi
Police shot the bitch but they didn't hurt her
Both upstate for attempted murder
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash, well pull ya card
Knowin' nutin' in life but to be legit'
Don't quote me boy 'Cause I ain't said shit
""Yeah, I kicked a little ass
But that was a blast from the past muthafucka
""Get busy ya ya ya yall"""
292,prelude,2006,eazy-e,Hip-Hop,"Good evening, and welcome to eazy's playhouse
You stupid muthafucka
Now that you got the album
What the fuck are you gonna do with it
Bitch
Easily I approach
The microphone because I ain't no joke
Tell your momma to get off of my tip
I have no time to give her my dick
I'm gonna hold it, and walk around the stage and
If you fuck up I'm goin' to get my gauge and
Unload the barrel and laugh
'cause I'm puttin' lead in your mothafuckin' ass
Psychopathic, but the hoes are attracted
Because when I'm on hard, my dick's at least a yard
In the days of old, I was a nut
Now I need at least 3 hoes when I fuck
'cause I do a check, nut 1 nut 2
Then I save a nut for when there's nothin' else to do
Get used to the crew, bitch, cause I would never quit
As soon as you think that's it I'm still talkin' shit
I told you that nigga was crazy
E boy, that's my boy, godamnit
I got a fable that you need to listen to
It's a funky little rhyme about a bitch or a two
One's sharon and the other one shaun
I want to nut but which one do I want?
Shaun said eazy let me fuck you blind
And sharon said e I want to blow your mind
I said fuck it, I know what should be done
Just pull your panties down and I'll fuck the biggest one
And then I get the
Other pussy put it in the freezer
So I can always have a on-hold skeezer
Yeah that's the ticket, I'll do it like that
So I told the hoes to take a big step back
Took the zipper down, eyes wide, and said
Here's what I'm gonna put inside
Grab it like a rabbit, grab it let's work it
But I won't love you when I'm done I'd still be talkin' shit ...
That boy'z good
Yeah that boy's good
That mothafucka'z talkin' all kinds of shit
I used to get pussy like eazy eric every day
You're mothafuckin' lyin'
How you know I'm mothafuckin' lyin'?
You're lyin', your dick can't get hard ..
Oh, suck my dick mothafucka
Nigga you lied
Who you're talkin' to..?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut that shit
Hey yo yella boy! wantcha rewind it!
Niggas don't see I'm a 100% legit
And you know it ain't about all that bullshit
It's about fuckin' this bitch and that bitch
But not the bitch with the 7 day itch, like that ho'
Just throwin' me the pussy
She says she wants to do it like a doggy
She's bad, nobody is badder
But she got more crabs than a seafood platter
Bitch on the gank move, to skeaze me
Just to say ""I got fucked by eazy""
So I slapped the ho' like a pimp
Oi might be a woman-beater but I'm not a pussy-eater
So when the shit hits the fan, it's outta my mouth
You don't like what I'm talkin' about?
All of ya'll can just suck my dick
You can quote me now cause I'm still talkin' shit
The boy's good, I told you the boy's good
The nigga has talent
You don't know a damn thing
Yeah, I like that part, bring that shit back one more time, maestro
That's that old z.z. hill, huh?
I can do the mashed potato nigga, what can you do?
I can do the bugaloo
Bugaloo!? that old shit been played out since 1967
Hey fuck you, fuck you"
293,luv-4-dem-gangsta-z,2006,eazy-e,Hip-Hop,"(Verse 1)
Aw shit, let's take a trip
Just sit back and light a spliff to this and don't step
On a funky-ass track jump back
Strapped with a gat and a sack and a 7-8 flak
Come clean, gangsta lean, I got green
But I serve dubs like it ain't no thing
I hang with OG niggas don't set trip
Or you might get a slug in your fuckin back
I don't slack when it come to street
I kick real g shit to a gangsta beat
It's so sweet, when you got money to spend
I got a cool-ass tilt and a fly-ass Benz
I make ends, spend my dough on no ho
That's how it is, nad that's how it goes
Act like ya know when I creep real slow
Givin love to them niggas that I know is real g's
(Chorus)
If you got love for them gangstas
Let me hear you one time if you down for the crime (that's right fool)
If you got love for them hustlas
Let me hear you say hooo if you makin straight dough (hooooo!)
If you got love for them playas
let me hear you say ooooh, ladies we want you (ooooooh!)
If you got love for them straight g's
Let me hear you motherfuckers just scream (heeeeeeey!)
(Sample from Eazy-E's ""Niggaz My Height Don't Fight"")
The Ruthless network, drive-by expert
Straight outta Compton, kickin up dust
The Ruthless network, drive-by expert
Straight outta Compton...
(Verse 2)
Dump dump on a nigga with a quickness
And they got no cure for this sickness
I get paid for the way that I kick this
Like a g-ster, an OG-ster (who's that?)
A real nigga named Eazy
And I live my life straight crazy
Don't need no punk niggas payin me
And broke groupie-ass bitches don't faze me
I take two step back and release myself
To put platinum-ass cuts on the record shelf
I don't brag, but i tell it like it straight-up is
Before you do a record, nigga, handle your business
And don't get caught slippin on the under
Or you might wonder (what's up with them ends, nigga?)
I call a spade a spade and get paid
G's show the way, so i give love to 'em
(Chorus)
If you got love for them gangstas
Let me hear you one time if you down for the crime (that's right fool)
If you got love for them hustlas
Let me hear you say hooo if you makin straight dough (hooooo!)
If you got love for them playas
let me hear you say ooooh, ladies we want you (ooooooh!)
If you got love for them straight g's
Let me hear you motherfuckers just scream (heeeeeeey!)
(Verse 3)
E-A-Z-why, must I
chase the cat and be a dog, a straight-up hog
I leapfrog to the sound of a gangsta beat
So I can hear my shit bumpin on a Compton street
That OG, see-are-I-P and S, G and S
Hip-Hop thugsta, so quick to rush ya
Straight to the dirt, fool I do work
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
That's how it is when it come to me
Cause I'm the long dick bust-a-nut nigga named Eazy
Bitches can't see me, hos say I'm crazy
But I don't think so, cause I'm just loco
I gives a fuck about a skanless bitch
let me hit it one time if you suck this dick
I don't trip, gives my dough to no ho
That's how it is, but I gives love to ya
(Chorus)
If you got love for them gangstas
Let me hear you one time if you down for the crime (that's right fool)
If you got love for them hustlas
Let me hear you say hooo if you makin straight dough (hooooo!)
If you got love for them playas

I'm starting to panic, I'm starting to sweat
'Cause I don't really wanna die yet
Dizzy spells, flashbacks in my head
Niggas ain't want me to bein' happy when I'm dead
But I ain't goin' out unless 30 niggas die
I'm dying anyway so I'm thinking suicide
Run into a crowd of niggas dyin' by the pistol
Took the motheruckin' whistle
24 hours to live
But I don't wanna die
24 hours to live
Oh why, oh why?
Must die
To sweep with the feet when he hit the concrete
Chop him up, dice him up and sacrifice his meat
Drag him by his ankles to the cemetary
(Screams)
Shut the fuck up nigga, 'cause you ain't seen shit
I'm 'bout to take this [unverified]and straight up grip
I'm holdin' the neck of the devil and drink his blood
Allowing my soul to be polluted by his evil root
And now I'm mad insane, red as [unverified]
As I strain for my heartbeat
To thumpety-thump to pump, it might burst
False alarms and no harm that will commit to the E
But now I'm down to an hour 23
Time is moving fast, but not that slow
I thought I had an hour, but it's seconds left the go
I ran into the office
No more time is left
I ran up to the doctor with a bomb to my
(Boom)
24 hours to live
But I don't wanna die
24 hours to live
Oh why, oh why?
Must die
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
As time winds down to it's last 24 hours
In an earth that weighs 60 trillion tons
Traveling 1,037 1/3 mph, how do you define time?
What is a minute? How important is an hour
When 24 hours becomes a lifetime?
Ooh, so define how do we define time?
Now you choose
How will you spend your last 24 hours?
C'mon, talk to me
24 hours to live
But I don't wanna die
24 hours to live
Oh why, oh why?
Must die
24 hours to live
But I don't wanna die
24 hours to live
Oh why, oh why?
Must die
24 hours to live
But I don't wanna die
24 hours to live
Oh why, oh why?
Must die"

Listen and listen well, he's a bad muthafucka
Gimme that goddamn book
Here let me read you this one, Christmas in Compton
It was a silent night, yes, a holy night
Until Mr. Claus turned into Santa muthafuckin', right?
Deck the halls with balls of holy

Merry Christmas, muthafucka
Merry muthafuckin' Christmas and a ho, ho, ho

In a candy right top 6-4, over the hills I go
Laughin' at this hoe, nuts on rich and rings
Makin' me feel right, oh, what fun it is to know
That I'm gonna get this pussy tonight
So ring them bells, ring them bells
She's takin' it all the way, oh what fun it is
To watch her suck my dick this way
Hey, ring them bells, ring them bells
Shes takin' it all the way, oh, what fun it is to nut
While she's suckin' my dick, oh, yay

And all the toys, boys and girls, fuck ya wishes
I got happy over joy in this muthafucka
No indo under my tree, so Santa be a sucka
[Unverified] when I was young, I was the only kid
Who had enough guts to be good ole hearin' on the East
I'd stay awake just to let America know
That Santa was a fake
I used to believe in Saint Dick when Elvis was alive
But all the fuckin' bullshit got played when I was five
Years, oh, just stay young, bold datin'
Singin' 'Silent Night' Carolin' recitin'
Now all I want for Christmas is my indo wreath

Two birds of cocaine

Takin' out profanity, so they can play it though
Listen to a hell of a kick and the high hat
Going to the record store say ya gonna buy
That the E is connected to the A and the Z ya say Y
So that's how the beats stack it up on material made of hits
Takin' my time of Eastline to make sure it fit
Push play on the instrumental that's recorded
Step on stage and I'm suddenly awarded
Some sort of track appeared like a plaque
And some hell of a screen from the girls in the back
Takin' a bow 'cause I got style
Never at the bottom of the ways on the top of the pile
Yo it's Eazy on top even though I'm short
Guaranteed to help when I walk on the court
So get up make some noise for the gangsta clap
Gonna tip the laugh I'm not a pranksta
I'm serious Dre my sounds
So quit playin' around
'Cause I'mma break it down
Last time I was takin' my time with this
But other suckaz were makin' a rhyme with this
I had to change the tip or make it hyper
But they was rotten, I was gettin' riper
Ready to go, like never before
Givin' you more because I'm ready to score
Ren is my buddy you can tell I said often
Helpin' me destroy the suckaz that's softin'
Curin' diseases, my rhyme pleases, throw it a key
Balls havin' seasons, this is a doc trim
And I'm locked in, and I made up my mind
And I think I'm gonna rock then
You got beaches chill and I'mma push ya
To freeze after I'll cut ya 'cause I'mma butcher
And say ya have pricin' and then out ya go
'Cause a percentage on point bellys are very low
Messin' with a gun but once ya get hurt
Like a said before ya get rushed to the dirt
I'm not a law man, but I'mma raw man
But ya the dopiest one I ever saw man
I keep droppin' it pound for pound
And when I'm on the mic I always throw down
To keep y'all dancin' to my funky sound
So listen now, 'cause I'mma break it down
Now look at me and not the poster
And you could see right off I got the most of
The talent, experience or a trade
And complements for the rhyme that's made
Talks over today if this one so
Pick another artist and dis one
I got the ballet of the chosen vote
'Cause I don't need water to clear my throat
Comin' from the rain the show is like dancin'
Nasty like and the girls are like glancin'
Wantin' to get wit' me this routine
Keepin' it sprung still stayin' mean
Can ya dis this man I don't think so
Once I start writin' the way I let the ink go
Comin' out with songs like hit after hit
'Cause this is legit and yours ain't shit
Makin' it sound so dope 'cause I'm a genius
But your amazed with ya happy to see this
Brother go crazy on wax
Flowin' away like if I was on a sax
Doin' a solo in the shade I'm a spotlight, relax and chill
While your uptight pumpin' up the funky sounds
Yo you should know it's kinda persist
That the E is gonna break it down"

Catch'em they get used as evidence
Only when they get brushed for finger prints
You ask Why am I like this?
'cause you wanna hear about shit like this
So I tell it,how I know it,Just hope the fuck I dont show it
Niggaz out frontn ,lottering and looting.
Lets recreate a drive by shooting
More brothers in a car blocks away
Waiting to spray, shotgun,Mack10 and an AK
They roll thru to a line of nigga's
It was 9 just like tha fuck they figured
Go around tha corner come back real slow
Lights off,cars in neutral,rolln at a snails pace and creepn
Hoping to catch all of them sleepn,a so called gang,drugs and sex (NWA)
Start busting a cap and all tha others jet,3 of'em fall to their doom
Pronounced dead at the scence,with gun shot wounds
3 dead 'cause Compton is scanless.
I'd like to tell ya brother, Ashes to Ashes,Dust to Dust (Amen)

Ruthless gangsta, definition villain,
Leave your shit unlocked and he's stealin',
So call tha police cause that's all you could do but,
He'll get away without leavin' a clue.

Ruthless gangsta, definition villain,
Leave your shit unlocked and he's stealin',
So call tha police cause that's all you could do but,
He'll get away without leavin' a clue.
Keepin' shit in control like the neighboorhood chief but,
Referred to as a walking thief,
They say he's a bad influence for the kids on the block,
Why the fuck they blamin' him,
He's the one that they jock.
Keepin' niggaz in line,
Whoever fucks with his rhyme,
And before you fuck with him,
You gotta fuck with his nine.
Not scared to pull the trigger on a punk ass nigga,
(A nigga) He could whoop his ass cause he's bigger.
Size don't mean shit,
He's from the old school fool,
He's a villain from the streets,
And he's supposed to rule,
Not sayin' he's in shit,
But he's down for mine,
He was put on the streets to keep niggaz in line.
Never givin' a fuck,
(huh?)
Because I know that he's a nigga that you want to be.
He can't help it he's in shit,
But he don't hold shit back,
He's a gangsta in black,
And he's about to attack.
[Eazy-E]
Cause I'm a ruthless villain,
Cold tearin' shit up,
Don't come on my face,
Pumpin' no kind of junk,
Eazy-E's in control,
And if you press your luck,
I'll smoke you like that,
And won't give a fuck.

Ruthless gangsta, definition villain,
You can lock up yo' shit,
He's Still Stealin',
Gettin' respect,
Cause the boy kicks butt,
But the real meaning is,
He don't give a fuck,
It's Eazy-E in the crowd,
But he's not in the 4,
I tell his money flow,
As he collects from his ho',
All expenses paid,
For the rhymes that he made,
Got the trophys in the house,
For the girls that he laid.
Not a wimp he's a pimp,
Now of course he's the boss,
So keep your bitch out his face,
Or else she's gonna get tossed.
The hard to be fucked with,
The boy got heart,
Wanna fuck with him,
He'll Rip your head apart.
Gangsta Gangsta,
That's what they yellin'
But him with his gangsta stroll,
He keeps bailin'.
Wherever he goes,
There's no discussion but silence.
They say that he's the one,
Promotin' gang violence,
That's a lie just a critic,
All that whack bullshit,
So let me tell you motherfuckers,
Who you fuckin' with,
[Eazy-E]
Cause I'm a ruthless villain,
Cold tearin' shit up,
Don't come on my face,
Pumpin' no kind of junk,

I'll smoke you like that,
And won't give a fuck.

The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause its do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? (why?)
Cause I'm ruthless for life
Nigga ten years passed and we still up in that ass
Will I make it or continue and
Look at all the s**t you in
Eazy does it like happy like the s**t we used to do
5 niggaz comin' out the C-P-T so f**k you
Time changed for the good
Niggaz in the hood be comin' up feel it
Can you set it off, for again, you know you should
Yo let's that this s**t back
To 1989
Where this nigga shoot and bust and niggaz know they couldn't find
Dream Team lovers
Egyptian fan base
Feelin' on the scene, all the fools got erased
Threw a mothaf**kin' monkey wrench up in the rap game
Since I hooked up with E, s**t ain't ever been the same
Opened up doors for the niggaz that be thinkin
that your flows be on tizight
Bitin' what I wrizite
Jokin' when I recite
Feelin' manuscripts
When I MC, if it ain't rough it ain't me
Chorus X2
Yo mothaf**kin' G'z, nigga like Eric Wright
You can floss for your b***h, but you know this s**t is tight
Cause when y'all niggaz started rappin', who'd you try and be?
I'ma slap you cause you lying, if you don't be sayin' me
Or the other 3, that the FBI be phone tappin'
Shoot the government before you niggaz started rappin'
Now its ? city, I gotta bomb it like Iraq
Use my alias, spend my nights at the shack
Ruthless attack all the way to two thou
Try to block it out, but you never knew how
And when I walk through the crowd
I'm seeing mothaf**ka's bread
I hear their b***hes sayin' ask MC Ren
Makin' fools sway when I roll to King Tet's
Because I started cussin' all you fools gettin' checks
Ruthless for life, see that be my state of mind
Y'all can kiss my black ass one more time
Chorus X2
I run a hundred miles just so I can MC
Villian want that bomb so I get with L.T.
Ain't nothin' changed
We find 'em, f**k 'em, then flee
While you hatin', pillow talkin', with that b***h, she want me
Niggaz weed crazy, Dre and Snoop turned you out
Now y'all cristal sippin', y'all niggaz be trippin'
Make the West look like ass, all full of s**t
Invest in drug money, s**t, still gettin' in
What it take for y'all quit
Ruthless got it on lock
Y'all shootin' videos tryin' to look like Pac
Here we come, here we come, blowin' up your spot
My little brother Jubee and the big homie Rock
Full circle, all this s**t gon' repeat
When this s**t drop, niggaz clownin' in the streets
The saga continues right before your eyes
Who really gives a f**k?
Cause this is ruthless for life

316,still-talkin,2002,eazy-e,Hip-Hop,"Good evening, and welcome to eazy's playhouse
You stupid muthafucka
Now that you got the album
What the fuck are you gonna do with it
Bitch
Easily I approach
The microphone because I ain't no joke
Tell your momma to get off of my tip
I have no time to give her my dick
I'm gonna hold it, and walk around the stage and
If you fuck up I'm goin' to get my gauge and
Unload the barrel and laugh
'cause I'm puttin' lead in your mothafuckin' ass
Psychopathic, but the hoes are attracted
Because when I'm on hard, my dick's at least a yard
In the days of old, I was a nut
Now I need at least 3 hoes when I fuck
'cause I do a check, nut 1 nut 2
Then I save a nut for when there's nothin' else to do
Get used to the crew, bitch, cause I would never quit
As soon as you think that's it I'm still talkin' shit
I told you that nigga was crazy
E boy, that's my boy, godamnit
I got a fable that you need to listen to
It's a funky little rhyme about a bitch or a two
One's sharon and the other one shaun
I want to nut but which one do I want?
Shaun said eazy let me fuck you blind
And sharon said e I want to blow your mind
I said fuck it, I know what should be done
Just pull your panties down and I'll fuck the biggest one
And then I get the
Other pussy put it in the freezer
So I can always have a on-hold skeezer
Yeah that's the ticket, I'll do it like that
So I told the hoes to take a big step back
Took the zipper down, eyes wide, and said
Here's what I'm gonna put inside
Grab it like a rabbit, grab it let's work it
But I won't love you when I'm done I'd still be talkin' shit ...
That boy'z good
Yeah that boy's good
That mothafucka'z talkin' all kinds of shit
I used to get pussy like eazy eric every day
You're mothafuckin' lyin'
How you know I'm mothafuckin' lyin'?
You're lyin', your dick can't get hard ..
Oh, suck my dick mothafucka
Nigga you lied
Who you're talkin' to..?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut that shit
Hey yo yella boy! wantcha rewind it!
Niggas don't see I'm a 100% legit
And you know it ain't about all that bullshit
It's about fuckin' this bitch and that bitch
But not the bitch with the 7 day itch, like that ho'
Just throwin' me the pussy
She says she wants to do it like a doggy
She's bad, nobody is badder
But she got more crabs than a seafood platter
Bitch on the gank move, to skeaze me
Just to say ""I got fucked by eazy""
So I slapped the ho' like a pimp
Oi might be a woman-beater but I'm not a pussy-eater
So when the shit hits the fan, it's outta my mouth
You don't like what I'm talkin' about?
All of ya'll can just suck my dick
You can quote me now cause I'm still talkin' shit
The boy's good, I told you the boy's good
The nigga has talent
You don't know a damn thing
Yeah, I like that part, bring that shit back one more time, maestro
That's that old z.z. hill, huh?
I can do the mashed potato nigga, what can you do?
I can do the bugaloo
Bugaloo!? that old shit been played out since 1967
Hey fuck you, fuck you"

Perched up high on a roof top
like a bird I'm havin' evil thoughts
a black hood covers my face
and death flows through my mind at it's own pace
sometimes I feel like a super hero
urgin' to free my kind
I'm so accurate
I shoot ya heart with a dime
now I'm back to the moral of my tale
I see a victim, and then my thoughts fail
my mind is still fumblin' with the present slavery
I'm here to save you but who's to save me
I hold my strap so long that my palms are all wet
I put finger on the button and then the sight'll check
I make the kill here's the deal
after the trigger's pulled then the death is sealed
so as the shots sing out like a piper
everyones scared of a neighborhood sniper
[Chorus]
[Eazy-E]
So my boy is a snitch
I put my gun up to his head
and simply scared the bitch boo
being the E ya know I'm thinkin' devious thoughts
take off ya clothes nigga and here comes a plot
his bitch was scared she made a move I pulled the trigger
now the room is red
now there's nothing left but the snitch
here's a four leaf clover punk make a wish
one [*Shot*] two [*Shot*] three strikes your out
this nigga is dead and now I'm lookin' for a window to get out
I made my escape the cops chase
duck into an alley so they don't recognize my face
the boy had to pay the piper
so they all stay in debt of a neighborhood sniper
[Chorus]
[Eazy-E]
I'm Doin' dirt by myself as I continue my mission
killin' all fools as an addiction
as the E lovin' the game leavin the shame
and in my heart I feel no muthafuckin' pain
because my heart is cold as I was told
and with the AK-47 I stand bold
rippin' up shit with the fury of my gun shot
pop pop pow as I watch the muthafucka drop
lovin' the sight as the blood spills
take a photograph, to keep in my hall of thrills I'm stayin' calm
and never hyper as I succeed in my mission
of bein' a neighborhood sniper

Oh wait here's a punk, pump the trunk

All the hump, some shit was said about blue and red
But I'm color blind and I gotta nine
Threw up the sign I cock the 9, I cock the 9.
Well nigga pop the 9and let it holla
Test drive wit a neighborhood's scholar
Black Impaler, blue chucks on gettin outta
Sucks on hip hop thugsta get the fuck on

Show me love or peel my cap quickly
My six sense won't let me slip don't puff wit the draggin' 'em

Obey my first and give him the taste
That's how I does it, that's how I do it
And the murder weapon that I use you know I threw it
He kept persuading so I had to do it, 'uh' play
For keeps that's the rule of the streets 'uh'.
Dick Tracy all on my nuttz like Cagny and Lacy
And don't faze me, Ruthless is the label that pays me
But this one H.K weighs a ton, words are yellow wit
The ? freaks on a run, bring ya condom in the kingdom
Huh ho from the ceilin to the floor, info red at ya window
Plus the E go hangin out the beamer tho
Drop shit like a seagull, for the people

And if you didn't hear me boy I'll tell you again
My name is eazy or just call me e
But it doesn't really matter to me
'Cause I'm the same person
Whether serious or rehearsin'
I just gotta keep cursin'
This is for the radio so I better chill
They won't play it if I could get ill
But I'm like that and that's an actually fact
Because the street is where my heart is at
Yo I don't do dope but I'm dope not a dope
But I'm doper than anybody who trys to cope
If the rhyme I'm dispayin'
And the beat that's playin'

So listen up close if ya don't ya might get lost
I'm not a role model or a Dr. Seuss yo I'm a gangsta
And I'm about to get stupid
I guess its time for the trama
With the E-a-z-why-e comma now that's drama
So pay attention by the way I must mention
I'm comin' off hard in the third demention
With the glare
But you don't need no glasses to stare
It'll probably take you in and it's just like your there
With the e on the gangsta tip
So if you think I'm a flip or slip don't even trip
'Cause I'm a destroyer
My homie Dre is a doctor not a lawyer
Dope MC employer on ruthless and that's my label
To get the money, the women, and co bust the fat cable's
Boy, master rhymers of toys
I mean straight while ya suckin' with the girls enjoy
You must be sick or ya lonely
How ya gonna diss me if ya don't even know me
Get the gat show 'em where it's at
And that's just the sound
And next time I'm peelin ya cap
To let ya know where I'm comin' from
Eazy said it and it shall be dunn
Wooooooo!

Radio jams are the part of the cycle
Eazy-er said than dunn yeah that's the title
Rubbin' the lady's only the fly ones ya know

Eazy come eazy go
Don't ask to battle me home boy what's that
You want to battle me boy ya better be strapped
'Cause where I'm from it ain't all about that playin'
Now that's what I'm sayin'
Sevy thought that I was born in '73
Now everybody want's to know the a-g-e
Girls on the tip fellaz too it seemed
Had everybody thinkin' I was only fifteen
The fellaz would annoy me
The ladyz would adore me
And what was I to do
I wishin' nothin' lady's do
'Cause the ladyz I luv 'em
Nice and then soft
I hate male groupies so just step the hell off
I'm the real eazy cause others be fakin'
Tryin' to game fame off the name I'm makin'
Sayin' on your records you could get some

Only if you want it
Yes I really want it
Can I get an eye open up
Eazy locin' up
Smokin' up
Much dust like a nut what
Give it up for the real stuff
Shut the what up
Back the shut up what
Hustler from the hood hoe
Hopin' and mud rub
The finishin' touches
Would sure went rubbers
Comin' in bunches
Could serve like lunches
Hold ya horses here's where the source is
Not very tall but never took a short kid
With a clip to claw
Wouldn't draw McGraw
I trick a law before all and all I'm raw
A naughty shorty, sporty with a forty
A laddy takin' tours, just to plan an orgy
A nasty critter, any hoe hitter
Hated my babysitter cause she wouldn't let me hit her
Now get up on it, on and on get on it
And I will pump it, only if you want it.
[Chorus]
Here's something from the ding dong cause
I really care how long ya been strong grown
Here comes the switch dome chrome
Couldn't hang with the king
Out the rudder but I call for a yes y'all toots
My style is just as fresh as a dusch bush
I face ya fact throw a heck just like woody wooder
And if I left that means I should of booger
Here's a new track, for all the new jacks
I'm kickin' it the hardest so gimmie my shoes back
So I live when I step it's the pimp
And I rep so make a right and get left quick
So try to play strong and long gone
The flow is kinda funky but far from Armstrong
Get up on it, on and on get on it
And I will pump it, only if you want it.
[Chorus]
Ooooooh a new jack! a new jack!
Kid I swear I saw a puddy cat
Back back smack, here comes a witty black
Endin' in a skull high I'm bout to show why
Eazy's fillin' caps cause my gat's in the low ride
Bang when the gat sneaks, two in the back seat
My homie rides shotgun waitin' to spot one
Duh is a fool who don't ride to slide to a ride
I'm shudder shakin' the place when I start hey
So don't butter, Eazy-E but a park hey
The only thing to flow these now to be fly is a feather
I see the smilin' faces of while they sick
Ya know me better, hard Rodney kid
Gettin' Cali kid, now ya know it boy
Left up in the alley dead
Now get up on it, on and on get on it
And I will pump it, only if you want it.

[Believe that, boy]
You're strapped?
[Yeah, you know it]
Let's go do this, man, I got it all planned out
[Yeah, shoot any motherfucker that moves]
[""Alright everybody...""]
This is a stick-up, everybody get face-down
Ren, gag their mouths so they can't make a sound
Tie 'em up for the fact that I'm kickin' ass
I got my hand on my gat, and I'm tempted to blast
My name is Eazy, but I go the hard way out
This ain't personal, but now I'm about
To commit a crime and go through with it
You know what, no need for shakin', because I'm used to it
Take out the security guard with a slap of my hand
Yeah, he's wearin' a badge, but he's a ol ass man
Pump his ass in the head, and take his gun
So me and the punk can go one on one
Cover the lens on the TV screen
You know, so me and my gang just can't be seen
Lock the doors, and throw away the key
Close the blinds, so no motherfuckers can see
And smile, you know, cause I'm controllin' the shit
And no sucker ass nigga's gonna stop the hit
Wardrobes and locs, and a Ruthless shirt
That means I'm ready to work, and rush a fool to the dirt, so
[Repeat x4]
[""Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt""]
[Alright, anybody move and I'll blow your fuckin' head off]
Alright
Empty your pockets, but do it slow
Take everything you got and lay it on the fuckin' floor
Don't make me have to set an example today
And blow one of you crazy motherfuckers away
I'm in a bank, and it's a little bit funny
Takin all you stupid motherfuckers' money
Peepin at a bitch cause my dick's on hard
Laughin at the dumb ass security guard
Who's tied up for the moment, not sayin' a word
I should have known it before, the motherfucker's a nerd
But back to the bitches I'm peepin
And then untie the hoe, so I can start creepin
Took her to the backroom, about to jack
Cold trailed the bitch, with a gun in the back
I said: ""Lay down, and unbutton your bra!""
There was the biggest titties that a nigga ever saw
I said: ""Damn"", then the air got thinner
Only thought in my mind, was goin' up in her
The suspense was makin' me sick
She took her panties down and the bitch had a dick!
I said: ""Damn"", dropped the gat from my hand
[What I thought was a bitch, was nothing but a man]
Put the gat to his legs, all the way up his skirt
Because this is one faggot that I had to hurt, so
[Repeat x4]
[""Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt""]
[I said get down. I want you all face-down on the floor
Anybody moves and I shoot]
Stackin up the money and there's more to collect
Cause I don't give a fuck, I take traveler's checks
Yo, Ren, peep out the window, and tell me what you see
[Three motherfuckin police starin at me; what to do now?]
Hurry up and get on
Allright, tell me, who is the motherfuckin alarm?
I'm a give ya a chance, and count to three
Or else five of ya bitches are comin with me
[Police: Allright, Allright, come out niggaz, or we're coming in
This is the only chance to turn yourself in]
Fuck you! We got hostages, and plenty of loot
And don't give a damn and not afraid to shoot
We're sendin out the hostages, all except five
And if you don't meet our demands, they won't stay alive
We want a copter, so we can get away clean
And take some pussy along, if you know what I mean
One hostage got brave, and got off the floor
But I smoked his ass before he got to the door
[Police: They shot a hostage, they shot a hostage!]
[MC Ren: You stupid motherfucker tryin' to run
Now you're dead as fuck tryin' to race a gun]
[Police: Allright, this is the last chance to get off your ass
Or else the tear gas is about to blast]
I ran to the back and Ren followed behind
To a hell of a spot that was hard to find
The bank was fucked up, the shit was smokin
With screamin hostages, runnin and chokin
Gettin away, but I was suddenly stopped
At point blank range, by a motherfuckin cop
And I hope they don't think that a lesson was taught
Cause a nigga like the E was finally caught
My gat wouldn't fire, the shit wouldn't work
So, y'all know what time it is
[Repeat x4]
[""Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt""]
[Police: Well I'm giving you five seconds to let us through the gate or
I'm gonna shoot two of your guards]

Come on, say it
EAZ-Y
Everybody come on,
EAZ-Y
People from everywhere gather around
Checkin' out the sound that Eazy is throwin' down
With some help from Ren and Dre
Makin' a way with dope style
Yo Eazy, what ya gotta say
A miracle of modern creation
Eazy E's on the set
Hyped up with the bass
And a little bit of what ya love
From a brother who's smooth like a criminal
I mean subliminal
Otherwise known as a villain
Because I'm ruthless
When I spot a sucker, I kill 'em
But most I think know not to deal with me
Yo, it's obvious, tell 'em who you came to see
EAZ-Y
Yeah 'cause this is the way I know you like it
So you won't strike it
I took it and I hyped it
And now that it's done, I know ya pleased
At how the E just dose it with ease
Just imagine a crowd screamin', a girl dreamin'
Just to get a picture of me 'n' my B-O-Y-Z
From the H-double-O-D
N.W.A., down with me
Strong 'n' I'm ragin'
Turn the page 'n'
See I'm not a son of a gun
I'm a gauge 'n'
Nothin' can avoid this shot 'cause it's hittin'
It's so cool when you touch it, wear a mitten
I'm comin' off raw into ya speaker
Makin' the suckers on the street feel weaker
But most I think know not to deal with me
Yo, it's obvious, tell 'em who you came to see
EAZ-Y
Aw, never, I'm just too clever
So, in fact, that no one can sever
A blow from a maniac and yo, I make it clear
So a register is all I hear
Money overturned, then I jet
To make another hit, for you to go and get
Record stores sold out because you love it
Another example of how Eazy does it

No, hoe but you can get my duck sick...

I got my nine fitted up with deadline
And don't let me hit the wetbomb
So watcha want to do?
The red, white and blue, I got some for you too

I don't give a fuck fuck...
Smoke mothafuckaz...
I'ma smoke mothafuckaz...
Cause I'm the ""E""
So you can kiss my black ass
Fuck the white house, it ain't my house
So you can burn the mothafucka down for all I care
Cause t-shirts and khakies is all I wear
I'm from the city where they show no pitty
For a punk ass mark in the park
Blow his brains out, stuck him in the bushes
Take his gat, leave his ass for the rats
And let me hit that cisco, I got a 187 on my pistol
Warrant by the LAPD
Key for puttin' in work out my trade
Because the president never simp
One dumb dog to my residents
I'm goin' crazy like 1980
I need my ends, fuck you, pay me
Or I'ma have to get the strap
My nutty O.G. buddy Big Black
I make you shit in your pants
And shake like jelly
So tell off my homie said hello...

You can't check a checker
But when you want to try let me know
I got the strecher on stand-by
Starvin' for a nigga like you
The things is much bigger
Than the trigger
So I can show how to put in work:
The Ruthless-network drive-by experts
Straight outta compton kickin' up dust
The place where guns don't get a change to rust
I warned them and they still approached me
Now I got two more golf-hats for my trophy
I got a brand new trend, it's killin' men
Who is that? That's my little friend...
I don't give a fuck...
I don't give a fuck...

327,no-more,1995,eazy-e,Hip-Hop,"We're sitting here with Eazy E
Believe that
How are you doing?
All right
So, Eazy, tell me, how was your life as a youngster ?
Ruthless, my style as a juvenile
Ran with a gang, slanged in the meanwhile
Bankin' , I specialized in gankin
whites, Mexicans, brothers and others
Daily, it's all about comin' up
Makin' sure no punks are runnin' up
Because I'm a gangster havin fun)
Strapped with a gat when I'm walkin' through Compton
Terrible, I never listened to my mother
It went in one ear, and out the other
Ran my gang, sold undercover
Call a girl out a name, yo I ain't no lover
I'm a pimp, mack daddy, lookin' for the dollar
At thirteen I bought a six-fo' Impala
Rollin, and runnin' from the police
Brother don't you know you can't trust a thief
or thug, convict, hoodlum or criminal
Leave your car open, gank for your stereo
Hard and raw, no regard for the law
(Eazy E, were you ever caught slipping?)
Hell no! Just trippin' off eight-ball
And girls ain't nothin' but female dogs to me
Bitches! I'm sorry for that verse
It's in my nature, I gotta curse
out anybody gettin' on my nerves
You get beat, ganked, broke and served
So you know who I am
and if you don't like it, I really don't give a damn
Hmm, I see, so you're rather violent?
Sometimes
Ok, what would be the situation when you so-called ""gank"" somebody?
Wait for some people to leave
I got another trick up my sleeve
Step with pep to the back of the house
Look then all the lights are out
Grabbed the door and it's locked, so
easily made my way to the window
Lift it up slow, cause it takes timing
Looked around, and then I climbed in
Once inside, I start takin'
Cause you know it's no time for shakin
Get what you gonna get, front and center
or get five years for breakin and enter
Move quickly, but no runnin'
Shht, I think somebody's comin'
Hear the front door key, and I flee
out the back door with a fist full of jewelry
Over the wall don't fall
Wipe my sweat cause that was a close call
gettin' ganked by the E is a lesson
So is there any more questions?
Yes, as a matter of fact, there is
Have you ever been involved in, like, a armed robbery or a hold-up?
You mean a two hundred eleven ?
Yeah
There's a store, but don't point
Walk inside, case the joint
One man behind the counter, another in the back
Go out to the car and load the gat
Grabbed the ski mask, here's the task
Go in broke, come out with cash
(Were you slick?)
Yeah, you gotta be cunnin'
Told Ice Cube to leave the car runnin'
Walked in, said: ""This is a robbery""
Didn't need the money, it's just a hobby
Fill the bag, homeboy, don't lag
I want money, beer, and a pack of zig-zags
The man in the back had a camera
so he came out to test his stamina
against Eazy E, but he took one
Fell to the floor, so I ran
back to the bucket, then I said: ""Punch it""
Took the gun, and then dumped it
I'm not like Robin Hood, cause I want more
Steal from the rich, hang with the poor
My pockets are fat, you see, it don't matter to me
I feel like nobody is badder than me
(Is all that true ?)
I don't lie
You see I'm not mister nice guy
Oh, so you're not exactly a role model?
Not exactly
And for your listeners, what does Eazy think of himself?
Bad and bold, you can't get with this
Those that tried, you're on my hit list
Can't be caught, sought or fought
thought, and damn so what?
Down and dirty from the C-P-T
N-W-A and Eazy-E
One more, before we end this session
(What's your real name?)
No more questions!"

Yo Dre give me a funky ass bass line.

What fuck is up? In the place to be.
Coming on the mic is Eazy Motherfucking-E.
Dre is on the beat.Yella's on the cut.
So listen right close while we rip shit up.
(Shit Up echoes while fading.)
Well I'm Eazy-E, I got bitches galore
You may have a lot of bitches but I got much more
Wit my super duper group coming out to shoot
Eazy-E, motherfuckers cold knocking the boots
'Cause I'm a hip-hop thugster, I used to be a mugster
If you heard (cash register), you think I own a drugstore
Getting stupid because I know how
And if a sucker talks shit, I give him a (POW)
8 ball sipping, the bitches are flipping
Slow down, I hit a dipping, continue my tripping
Hitting my switches, collect from my bitches
The money that I make so I can add to my riches
Fill my stash box and start rubbing my gat
Feeling good as hell because my pockets are fat
A hardcore villain cold roaming the streets
And wit a homie like Dre just supplying the beats
Because I'm a ganster having fun
Never leave the pad without packing a gun
Hitting hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it
Boy you should have known by now, Eazy does it
I was knocking motherfuckers out
What's your name boy
Funky, fresh Eazy-E
Kick, kick that shit
Where you from fool, Compton, yea
Rolling through the hood, cold tearing shit up
Stick my head out the window and I say what's up
To the niggas on the corner cold bumping the box
But you know that's an alibi for slanging the rocks
A dice game started so I said what the fuck
So I put my shit in park and had to try my luck
Hard to roll wit my bitch jocking 24-7
Rolled them motherfuckers, ate 'em up, hit 11
Got another point, I made a ten a fo'
Was taking niggas money and was itching for mo'
Laughing in their faces and said you're all making me rich
Till one punk got jealous, cold slap my bitch
He pulled out his gat, I knew he wouldn't last
So I said to myself, homeboy, you better think fast
He shot (gunshots), Then I shot (gunshots)
As you can see, I cold smoked his ass (ha ha)
Because I'm a ganster having fun
Never leave the pad without packing a gun
Hitting hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it
Boy you should have known by now, Eazy does it
(Wait a minute, wait a minute, who does it)
Motherfucking Eazy does it
But how does he do it
Eazy does it do it eazy
That's what I'm doing
Stop
Man what ya gonna do now
Now I'm a break it down just to tell a little story
Straight out the box from the gangsta category
About a sucker, a sucker motherfucker
He's addicted, he's a smoker but in Compton called a clucker
He used to have a house car and golden rings
But the cooky cooky crack took all those things
He must of been starving 'cause he broke in my house
Caught the nigga on the street and straight took his ass out
Now I wanted for a murder that I had to commit
Yea I went to jail but that wasn't shit
Got to the station about a quarter of nine
Call my bitch to get me out 'cause I was down for mine
The bitch was a trip cold hung up the phone
Now my only phone call was in the ganking zone
All the SHIT I did for her like keeping her rich
I swear when I get out, I'm gonna kill the bitch
Well by now you should know it was just my luck
The baliff of the station was a neighborhood cluck
I looked him straight in the eye and said what's up
And said let's make a deal, you know I'll do you up
Now back on the streets and my records are clean
I creeped on my bitch wit my uzi machine
Went to the house and kicked down the do'
Unloaded like hell, cold smoked the ho
Because I'm a ganster having fun
Never leave the pad without packing a gun
Hitting hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it
Boy you should have known by now, Eazy does it
From around the way, born in '73
Hardcore B-boy named Eazy-E
It's '88 now, '73's obsolete
A nigga with a serious ass attitude and 100% street
And if you all wanna hear some more
In one way or the other, I'm a bad brother

Motherfuckers said it wasn't gonna work
That crazy shit, yeah the stupid shit
Hey yo Eazy! (Yo!)
Hey man why don't you come off the piano for a minute
And bust this crazy shit
Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begins
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride
I got front back and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin' new shit by NWA
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this
Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that GTA
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
Down on B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JB is on freebase
The boy JB was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellows out there, makin' that dollar
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'
Left to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control
Then wrapped the six-fo' round the telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another""
Walkin home and I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Kat got beat for resistin arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is cut for doin the crime
For defense on the boy, he'll do some time
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellaz start to riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork
""Disruption of the court"", said the judge
On a six year sentence my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out ""fire!"", then came Suzi
The bitch came in with a sub-machine uzi
Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit

Just sit back and light a spliff to this and don't step
On a funky-ass track jump back
Strapped with a gat and a sack and a 7-8 flak
Come clean, gangsta lean, I got green
But I serve dubs like it ain't no thing
I hang with OG niggas don't set trip
Or you might get a slug in your fuckin back
I don't slack when it come to street
I kick real g shit to a gangsta beat
It's so sweet, when you got money to spend
I got a cool-ass tilt and a fly-ass Benz
I make ends, spend my dough on no ho
That's how it is, nad that's how it goes
Act like ya know when I creep real slow
Givin love to them niggas that I know is real g's

If you got love for them gangstas
Let me hear you one time if you down for the crime (that's right fool)
If you got love for them hustlas

And I live my life straight crazy
Don't need no punk niggas payin me
And broke groupie-ass bitches don't faze me
I take two step back and release myself
To put platinum-ass cuts on the record shelf
I don't brag, but i tell it like it straight-up is
Before you do a record, nigga, handle your business
And don't get caught slippin on the under
Or you might wonder (what's up with them ends, nigga?)
I call a spade a spade and get paid

Are wonderin' how the stupidest kid up in the class made it
Sick landscapin' and jammin' down in my mans basement
Getting restraints and complaints from mad neighbors
Now prejudice bigots say I sound just like them damn #%#
Them pair of lenses ain't repairin' their impaired vision
I'm on a mission escaping my own prison
Inflicting more pain then you're givin' see I'm my own victim
I can't believe I let you take up my time
Take up space in mind, give it here, I'm takin' what's mine
(Chrous)
The only ounce of power that I have
Is what I do with now
And how I let the hours pass
I dont' know how long I'm gonna last
So I can't let ya snatch the powder out my hourglass
Everyday that I'm awake I face the angel of death
He may be taken my breath, so they can lay me to rest
And by now my inner state's the only place that I rep
The way that I dress is just another way to express
We know that some day everybody we see will be dead and rotten
Long forgotten, we oughta keep this for a normal topic
Because we all get caught up in all the drama
But what's the gossip gonna mean, when me and you are goners
See I never did audition for a part in this play
I know that some day I'll accidentally fall in my grave
So I can really give a shit about what all of ya say
According to me is how I'm spending all of my days
(Chorus)
The world will keep turnin', the inferno will keep burnin'
But it's affirmative my life on Earth is impermanent
And since I'm visiting and my minutes here are limited
I ain't havin' or doin' shit if I ain't feelin' it
I'll lend a hand to a hurt pedestrian and I will help a friend
In any way that I can, but I can't let man get up in the way of my plans
Make me stray from my path, I can't be takin' that chance

We suffer in this land then we leave it empty-handed
Experienced a fraction of eternity then vanish
I never took advantage, I just took it all for granted
In my youth man, I used to smoke a quarter a night
Was bored of my life, ignoring all the glorious sights
I was lost getting caught up in all the hype
It took me ten years to get my priorities right
I'm up close and personal with my daily abuse
But all you fairies say spare me cause you're scared of the truth
Chorus
Why oh why must everyone be in disguise
You get nothing out of living lies
Why? Cause everybody needs to hide
Why oh why must everyone be in disguise
You get nothing out of living lies
Why? Cause everybody needs to hide
You know I really think it's funny
When you're flaunting all your automobiles
Cause I know that money's something that you oughta conceal
The more you reveal the more we know it all isn't real
I bet you frauds keep talkin' till your coffin is sealed
But it's ok, you behave in anyway that you want
Cause I can look you in the face and know you're fakin' the funk
So take a second and brace yourself for taken this punch
You may leave a little shaken when I break through your front
Chorus
I was just another white kid who suffered an identity crisis
I ain't the only one I know that many are like this
So I did it how I did it never cared if they liked it
Kids got so excited they were ready to bite shit

To be hittin' all you critics that are stereotypin'
My only problem is I got plenty of vices

To your soul through flesh and denim
I kill every opponent with the message that I send 'em
And I leave 'em, with no heart-beatin', the lungs breathin'
Their last thought was questioning the demon they believe in
Forcing me to start kickin' mental martial arts
Piercing they hearts, with all these metaphorical darts
Make use of this verbal abuse and call a truce
'Cause the verse hurts worse, and works quick as a noose
Stop frontin', you wantin' my mouth to stop running
Some sought assault, but the thoughts kept comin'
The last man who tried, well, he died in his sleep
I can't believe what I was saying put him 6 feet deep
Diagnosed with an overload flow to his brain
I guess the truth that I told him, must have drove him insane
Any rough @.$@., can pull the trigger, but I'm bigger
The poisoned lyrics make you sick quicker than liquor
So go blast your gun, I'm gonna be the one who'll be yellin' victory
When all is said and done son
Now I'm battling my wars
With chords and metaphors
Lord knows the pen's mightier than the sword
Armed with my thoughts and the almighty force
For sure the pen's mightier than the sword
Destroy the flesh, but the core will endure
Of course the pen's mightier than the sword
So blow me up with a bomb, I'll move on and go beyond
Like the wayward son, and carry on
I'm forever green, I'm what you never seen before
What you thought was raw was far from hardcore
I'm alive on a compact disc, I never miss, I always hit
Assuring I'll forever exist
Three times as arrogant as Cannibis is
Now they teaching classes, calling it The Borial-Analysis
I grip the mic as if I'm never gonna pass it
When I spit the ancient and eternal to the masses
Enthusiastic, opposite of plastic
Just recorded this shit, and it's already classic
Man on a mission, holding my position
With no war paints, just poetic ammunition
Now I'm battling my wars
With chords and metaphors
Lord knows the pen's mightier than the sword
Armed with my thoughts and the almighty force
For sure the pen's mightier than the sword
Destroy the flesh, but the core will endure
Of course the pen's mightier than the sword
Combat, without physical contact, you're under attack
Gettin' bashed, smashed, slashed, and gashed
With the sharp tongue, piercin' your ear drum
It's fearsome, slinging your gun son, I ain't even got one
I'm doing what I say, and saying what I mean
With words that cut clean from a poet supreme
I flip tha Tai-Chi Chuan, droppin' terrorist bombs
With blood from Lebanon like Kahlil Gibran
I reside in the hills outside the city walls
Behind closed doors with the infinite source
While you're dwellin' in your hood, inhaling the smog
I'll be in the woods, puffin' logs talkin' to God
Uninvolved with ya'll, I'm watchin' all far from afar
Loungin' on a mountain top, countin' the stars
Now I'm battling my wars
With chords and metaphors
Lord knows the pen's mightier than the sword
Armed with my thoughts and the almighty force
For sure the pen's mightier than the sword
Destroy the flesh, but the core will endure
Of course the pen's mightier than the sword
Mightier than the sword (3X)"

So sick of listening to a bunch of synonyms

Now you gonna have to hear another cracker rapper
Still hearing all of these people callin' me a wannabe
But I'm gonna keep it going 'cuz you heard them all from me

Your still gonna hear the white trash hip-rock.
You can cover your ears, but the noise won't stop,
You know your still gonna hear the white trash hip-rock,
You can cover your ears, but the noise won't stop!
See everything's a challenge when you're chemically imbalanced
So I thought a single soul would never see my talent
Y'all figured by now that I would throw the towel in
Tellin' me repeatedly the genre's overcrowded
But some of these cats are done with the past
And I wonder if they ever had a love for the craft
No you'll never see my turntablist in the back, pretending to scratch
Cuz anyone who did it is wack.
Chorus
To all the Blinks, Eddie Vedders and the Kurt Cobains
It's a shame you impersonators sound the same
You can't resurrect a legend and emulate the veteran
Man I would love to level the devil who let them in
Instead of breaking out a switchblade and carving it in
I'll address the enemy and stab his heart with a pen

I'll go toe-to-toe with you, at your own dojo,
Want none of you bozos at my show,
where some silly hoe's shakin' her ass up in my video

So what! you sold records, you ain't respected,
You went too far and tried too hard to be accepted,
This can never be a thing of jealousy,
Just don't be tellin' me to check the melody,
I got the better beats, got the better rhymes,
I made sure I bettered mine ahead of time
So what's up kid? Your big head's been busted,
Don't get disgusted, I'm just servin' justice.

So I keep searching, livin' and learnin',
Earnest to earn everything I'm deservin'

I'll be standin' on the street corner panhandlin'!
You won't see what you want from me,

But I'll approach it with no fear
When the smoke clears I'll find my spirit is still here
May take years to find it the prophets are real
Too much damage to inhabit the planet, that's severe
I talk shit you heartless paupers can't feel
With concepts the smartest robber can't steal
Your fears will cause all ya'll to pour tears
Cause the bomb that I'm droppin' is landing, so stand clear
Are there any queers here in the theater tonight?
We'll get 'em up against the wall and stick 'em with dynamite
Cause there's something going on in my head that ain't right
But I'm getting ready to take flight, so hang tight

If you're thinking small, we all rise and fall

No one alive is surviving the holocaust

If your thinking small, we all rise and fall
Don't gonna try to abide by the law
No one alive is surviving the holocaust
Fuck partying like it's 1999
Ain't watching the ball fall, ain't calculating time
Watching polar caps melt, and the coastline rise
See the ocean divide, and nine planets align
Sun shining too bright, igniting the Alpines
With petrified eyes were watching at ringside
Can't run, you can't hide, panicking worldwide
When straight out the sky, falls great balls of fire
I'll sneak on the spot where the shuttle is launched
Strap me and a broad onto a rocket and blast off
We'll be following the way of the Force like Star Wars
And I'll start a new fam' when I land on Mars
It don't matter if you're standing tall
If you're thinking small, we all rise and fall
Don't gonna try to abide by the law
No one alive is surviving the holocaust
It don't matter if you're standing tall
If you're thinking small, we all rise and fall
Don't gonna try to abide by the law
No one alive is surviving the holocaust
Now when the end comes, and your time here is done
Will you look back and say, overall, it was all fun?
Well life's been good to me so far like Joe Walsh
But it won't break my heart if it all falls apart
It don't matter if you're standing tall
If you're thinking small, we all rise and fall
Don't gonna try to abide by the law

I watched your movement from the corner catch my eye.
Imagining you here right by my side.
The fire in your eyes is blazing, and it burns right through me.
Little girl your so amazing.
Don't you know you drive me crazy, and I'd love to get to know you. Here I am so won't you take me and blow me away.
You seem so close.
If I could know your thoughts, if I could read your mind.
Some things are never meant to be defined.
It's now or never.
Here I am.
There you are.
Wish upon a falling star"
464,surefire,2007,brightwood,Rock,"Looking back, no turning back.
Wouldn't take it back for a second.
So unsure yet unashamed love.
You turn my world upside down.
Open up your heart and let me in.
Open up your eyes. Don't you see?
When I'm with you I loose control.
When I'm with you I am irrational.
And when you're near I fall in love.
Gripping fears unknown.
It's getting harder to breath.
The little things that guarantee.
And this slow surefire dance.
I need you to know that I want you this way.
I'll take everything you are.
I'll take the fall for you.
Show you I will...give everything I am"

I am true

I am all these things

Attempt to save yourself from what you know
Had to happen
Come alone
Come alone

You knew me from the inside
Your eyes on mine, on mine, and I'm
I'm afraid and alone with your eternal love in my hands
And this bread, your body
I know, I know, I know, you know
Come alone
From the garden to the hill
Come my love
I have fallen
I have betrayed
So irresolute in my mind
I can't stop pacing, anticipating
Could this be my fate in the end?
Cause I'm afraid in the light of the look in your eyes when they're locked on mine
I turn away, cause I know you see right through me
Come alone
From the garden to the hill
Come my love
I have fallen
I have betrayed you
Here I lie
My guilt is my sentence
You have been my life
I will end it with a kiss
Come alone, my love
My love, my love

It feels like you're back from the dead.
But still I can't believe it's over,
And I can't get your sight, your scent from my head.
It seems like these moments are lasting forever,
The times when we felt alive.
You carried my heart in the midst of this battle
In your hands.
This time I won't try to reach you.
You're already too far gone.
Slipped past and I didn't notice,
Did we ever sing the same song?
Two lives, two books of illusion,
A chapter in the essence of time.
The story we wrote in one season,
Came to an end in one night.
Remember the times when we started believing,
That everything would be alright?
You carried my heart in the midst of this battle...
In your hands.
And I'll wait for you. I'll become something new.
And I'll sing for you until this dream comes true"

Sometimes it never comes because it passes by without calling,
looking for somebody to love.
Sometimes when it comes it is late,because
there is already someone else in its place instead.

It knows no boundaries,nor distance,

is to forgive everything without reproaches,
to forget ,

Sometimes it never comes because it passes by without calling,
looking for somebody to love.
Sometimes when it comes it is late,because
there is already someone else in its place instead.

It knows no boundaries,nor distance,
no place,has no age.
It could come and get lost

is to forgive everything without reproaches,
to forget ,

It is to give without expecting something in return...

I paid seven saw mill dollars for a bracelet
Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind.

Layin' by these railroad tracks in Denver
With a hurtin' head and a half a pint of wine
Everything except my soul has been surrendered
Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind.
The cabin that I built in West Virginia
Was not enough to keep you satisfied
'Cause a man that's got a saw mill occupation
Can't afford to feed a rich girls' appetite

I know you can move a mountain, take the stars out of the sky
You can send down a rainbow, you can even turn the tide
Once you even made a blind man see, changed the water into wine
I need a miracle, please Jesus, would you change her mind?
When she was here beside me, lord you know how good it was
Who have ever thought back then I could have lost her love?
Now I'm standing here a broken man, I can't make it by myself

About the years gone by
How he played his horn down in New Orleans
In some old dingy dive
""I knew 'em all back then."" he said
As he reached out for his horn
He closed his eyes - and wet his lips
Then the blues were born.
He played with so much feelin'
Tears came from his eyes
He stopped and reminisced a bit
And then he gave a sigh!
Said, ""You know, I almost made it
But that was before your time
Dixieland, Po' Folks Blues
ScatMan Jack and wine.""
Slapped his knee and gave a grin
It sure was good back then
Reaching for his horn on the floor
Placed it in an old towsack
That hung across his back
He said ""Goodbye!""
And shuffled out the door.
Enthused by what he told me
I never got his name
So, I called the waitress over
And started to explain
A tired old man - his tarnished horn
Mem'ries of years gone by
How he played his horn and reminisced
Smiled with tear-dimmed eyes.
She said you are mistaken
There's been no one but you
But I know who you're talkin' 'bout
I used to know him, too
You'll find him down on Basin Street
In back of an old churchyard
A stone that reads, ""Rest in Peace
I tried but it sure was hard.""

Neon lights from an old beer sign
Shown through the window out on the sidewalk
As I walked in to pass the time;

Ordered beef on rye and a glass of wine
And through the door came a little old lady
She was selling paper roses and they only cost a dime.
Paper Rosie, Paper Rosie
She sold you Paper Roses, but they only cost a dime.
Silver hair that's lost its' Gold
Trembling hand as she passed the rose
Red Crepe paper, made nature's bouquet
Help a little old lady buy a rose today;
I took the rose from her trembling hand
With eyes of age, she smiled and walked away
Like a breath of spring I could smell the rose
It came alive and I heard her say.
Buy my Roses, pretty roses
They're only made of paper
But they only cost a dime.
I went to look for her outside
A spray of roses lay by her side
The sky lit up and the choir sang
A thousand voices as the church bells rang.
They sang Rosie (Rosie), paper Rosie (Rosie)

I guess I always knew there'd
Come a time we'd meet this way
It's good to see your face again
How long has it been
It seems like only yesterday.
You know I still remember
Time we spent together
Little things we'd do and say
The night you said goodbye
Stays here on my mind
As if it were only yesterday.
I feel the unrelenting march of time
And every day I fall another day behind
I want no other love, I wish on stars above
Not for tomorrow only yesterday.

And you think you'll feel better if you have a good cry
But save those tears for tomorrow when there's nothing better to do
It's a beautiful night, don't waste it on the blues
Time is all it takes for a broken heart to mend
And sooner or later you know you'll try to love again
So why not start tonight, you've only got the hurtin' to lose
There's a full moon out, don't waste it on the blues
Don't waste one more minute
Leavin' a bad break, to keep you home in the dark
There's nothin' like a walk in the moonlight
To let love run away with your heart
You could turn on your stereo and play your saddest songs
Sit by your window and stare out all night long

We're so accustomed to each other
We no longer care or bother
And there lies the danger
You know the size of clothes I wear
You know how I comb my hair
But you could know as much about a stranger
I can't remember the last time
That I really wanted you
And we both say nothings wrong
But it's here in everything we do
So we get up from our beds
Leaving many thing unsaid
And there lies the danger
Many of my words you don't hear
You seldom notice if I'm near
You could know as much about a stranger
What went wrong, I can't name it
Find the fault, I can't blame it

Why do you always try to make me over
Take me as i am or let me go
White lilies never grow in fields of clover
Take me as i am or let me go.
You're tryin' to reshape me in a mold love
In the image of someone you used to know
I won't be a-standin' for an old love
So take me as i am or let me go.

Street vendor cry ""filet gumbo""
From my window I see him, going
Down the street and he don't know
That we fell right to sleep
In the damp tangled sheets so soon
After love in the hot afternoon
Now the bourbon street lady,
Sleeps like a baby in the shadows
(in the shadows)
She was new to me, full of mystery,
But now I know (but know I know)
That she's just a girl,
And I'm just a guy, in a room
Full of love in the hot afternoon
We got high in the park,
This morning and we sat, without talkin'
Then she came back here,
In the heat of the day, tired of walkin'
Where under her breath,
She hummed to herself a tune
Of love in the hot afternoon"

So when she brought 'em here tonight
I was expecting to see that same dang doe tears bounce
But she's a looking like a new woman
My, would you look at that dress
Every eye is on her
She is a walking, talking, little miss confident
Yeah, she's a looking like a new woman
She's got my buddies in the palm of her hand
And it's a hell of a time for me to be her actual man
How did she go from stone cold to red hot, open tonight
All this honey she is pourin', she must have kept bottled all the time
'Cause heaven knows that I can't believe, that little devil's my used to be
This might be fair play, boys but she ain't playin' right
She's a looking like a new woman
She is in neon light
She's gone from every day square
To party hardy, wild thing, overnight
Yeah, she's a looking like a new woman
Sleek blond with a faking big ten
Sure hits a bad time for me to be her actual man
She's emptying every barstool, got the boys formed in a line
I think I'll slip on back 'cause I can't take the sight
But her a looking like a new woman
My, would you look at that dress
Every eye is on her
She is a walking, talking, little miss confident
Yeah, she's a looking like a new woman

Just tell me that you're leaving and you'll be gone for good
But speak softly, you're talking to my heart
True love is a treasure that few men ever find
I thought that I'd found it from the start
Now it's over, it's so over
Only a fool would stay to watch it fall apart
How I tried to change your mind
I sold my soul, lost my pride
What's that reflection in your eyes

And, lying helpless, I know just how I'll burn
Back in the fire where my heart must long to be
If it wasn't so, then why, oh, why does it keep draggin' me?
Back in the fire to the flames of ecstasy
I guess I'll always love the way she burns in me
At times I've gone as far as believing
This tortured soul of mine was finally free
Then those long, silent, leftover feelings
Say I'm a pretender, and I'll surrender willingly
Back in the fire where my heart must long to be
If it wasn't so, then why, oh, why does it keep draggin' me?

To get home to my memories of you

Like treasure packed away they get me through
To fit my sad time, I just go through my mind
And pick out the perfect memory of you
I don't feel lonely anymore that's what they don't see
There's so many happy thoughts of you that I can use
It's not real life but I know you're still mine

Two hearts breakin down
Weve been fightin each other

And little by little, were losin it all
We saw it comin, the end of the line
Weve been hurting each other, time after time
Over and over, we ignored what we saw
And little by little were losin it all
Your fault or my fault, nobody cares
It no longer matters, there's just nothing there
But a few tiny pieces waiting to fall
And little by little we're losin' it all

I can't stop the winter from turning into spring
Or summer giving way to autumn winds
But if I could take the world and make it face the other way
Then you'd love me forever again
If I had a way of changing time
I?d stay busy turning back the pages
If I could make a miracle, I'd make one just for you
And you'd be loving me forever too

And that's when I started rollin'
Drinkin' my way back home
Drinkin' my way back home
Listenin' to a honky tonk song
I hope the Devil in my soul don't steer me wrong
'Cause I'm drinkin' my way back home
I can feel that Texas sun
Down on this redneck of mine
Every time I pop top
I'm getting closer to the Arkansas line
I left a trail of Lone Star beers
From here to San Antone
So, baby, here I come, don't worry
Drinkin' my way back home

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last
I found a dream that I could speak to,

We're givin' on each others heart
Our love grew till it ran out of room
Now it looks like we're growing apart
We had a mountain of our very own
That turned out we just couldn't climb
We've just been waiting for something to give
And we've been standing in line

But sometimes I get lucky and forget
Sometimes I can close my eyes and you're not waiting there
Constantly reminding me how much you used to care
And losing you is one thing I guess I'll always regret
But sometimes I get lucky and forget
Sweet Rose and burgundy just lead to scotch and rye
At times it hurts me so much I just hang my head and cry
No, it ain't been easy for me, I'm not over you yet
But sometimes I get lucky and forget
Sometimes I can close my eyes and you're not waiting there

There's no way to completely drown memory

Wat is los? Ah Ah!

Sie erreichen Ihre Ziele, denken Sie groÃ
Ein bisschen GrÃ¶Ãenwahnsinn kann nicht schaden

Trinken Sie den Baikalsee auf ex
Zum FrÃ¼hstÃ¼ck Blattgold auf die Smacks
Starten Sie durch, wie die Antonow
Denken Sie an Dollars und entfliehen dem Moloch

Fahr'n Sie durch die Stadt mit 'nem Monstertruck

So wie BaumgÃ¤rtner, wenn er in das All fliegt
In harten Zeiten muss man Leistung zeigen
Wie ein Schwertransport voll mit Platinscheiben
Hier geht's um hÃ¶her, schneller, weiter
Kaufen Sie kein Weed man, kaufen Sie Jamaica
Bauen Sie kein Reihenhaus, bauen Sie ein'n Vorort
Und herrschen Sie dort als glÃ¼cklicher Warlord
Denken Sie groÃ, wie der Benzinverbrauch
Von 'nem Containerschiff, dann geht es bergauf
Wo bleibt Ihr Einsatz, wo bleibt der Wille
Lasern Sie die Welt und dann weg mit der Brille

DK ist zurÃ¼ck mit wunderschÃ¶nen Melodien
Die-die-die Kalotte clippt, und sie fangen an zu streamen
Immer noch die GÃ¶ren, keine Chance, sie zu erziehen
Nicht so wie Jay-Z, wir benutzen Autotune
Wir laden es ins Netz, denn sie lieben den Konsum
Silly Walk Exzess, vÃ¶llig ungeniert
Wir agieren so zielgruppenorientiert
Dom PÃ©rignon und dann macht die Buddel peng
Der Turbo aus dem Game kommt aus der Lameng
Wir mÃ¼ssen nix erklÃ¤r'n, denn das ist unser Slang
Du hÃ¤ngst in deiner Gang, aber wir hÃ¤ngen mit Sven

Wer macht denn heute noch so 'ne Musik?
Bei der Stellensuche, in der guten Stube
Endlich lÃ¤uft mal wieder so 'ne Musik
Auf der Party neulich, beim Guerillaschaukeln
Und aus dem Auto ballert so 'ne Musik
Beim Elternabend, beim KaterfrÃ¼hstÃ¼ck und im Oval Office

Ob Chili-Cheese Pop, oder heftigster Mosh
Erschaff' deine Welt, darin fÃ¼hlst du dich safe

Der zerrockte Clown zerfeiert euch zu Staub
Wir zelebrier'n den Krach, danach smashen wir Gitarren
Wir hol'n die TrÃ¶ten raus, und fall'n vÃ¶llig aus'm Rahmen
Lalalala-Bumm, die Musik geht aus dem Leim (Leim)
Wie Primaten kloppen wir auf Stock und Stein (Stein)
Wir drÃ¼cken die ganze Nacht auf die acht null acht (acht)
Und bauen uns Papierflieger aus Noten von Bach (Bach)
So 'ne Musik, beim Reifenwechseln, auf der Touri-Meile
Du hast richtig Bock auf so 'ne Musik
Beim Pubertieren, in der Midlife-Crisis
Denn deine Seele braucht so 'ne Musik
Im Hobbykeller, beim Klinkenputzen, in der Tagesklinik
So 'ne Musik, bei der Weiterbildung
In der Todeszone, der ganze Laden feiert

My parents threw me out cause
I was the Devils work

I said if religions so great
Why does it come with a price
They sent me to hell C.O.D.
They sent me to hell cash on delivery

The jocks and the rednecks
They just don't understand
Why I won't pay the price
To be in the promised land
The mothers they don't want
Their children near me
So they'll never copy the behavior they see

Trying to grab some nookie
But my fingers get burnt
I run in circles looking for a way out

That would just be too Ooh hoe hoe hoe factitious
And I aint dropin just another clich
Wits say someones gotta start this discourse
And if you wanna pass hey yeah yeah this course
Facts dont rest with Adam and Eve
Just leave the past or youll be deceived
The mission today today, today is to fight for equality
In actuality that means quality action quality action
Thats if you fancy a true connection
We gotta set the table and go full course
I promise you wont dose oh no no no
Curiositys got you going louse on my noise
Cause this time I spit whats stored in your heart
I must be hinting on silence
Compared to violence Silence is just as crude
Dude I could lie but I promised to set the mood
(set the mood, yeah-yeah set the mood. Oh-oh)
On the rhythm of love
The rhythm of love
The rhythm of love
The rhythm of love
When you see quiet waters
Hey, yeah yeah yeah na na
It could be that deep down underground
where the sound is bona fide
(Troubles winning an award for destruction yeah yeah)
Couples in correlation making promises but no action
Empty words sounding smooth
like African Boys versus (yeah yeah yeah)
Silent love portrayed in purple blue stains
Shes in chains, but shes deceived
And she believes (oh) that shes weak
Solitude scares her more (scares her more)
And so she stays in shackles
Making you and I (ooh na na na na) believe that those are jewels of love
Dream on if you believe dream on (na na na na ooh dream on, dream on)
Talk about shackles, (fetters they be hidden too)
Sisters wanna play (mould the clay)
See how we play our artistic flavour on brothers
She cant find Mr. Right
No no no no no
But she sure knows how to choose him right
Shes got the craft to make him spot on
Her favourite game? (To put the puppet show on)
And if he doesnt wanna bend
She wont say nothing but give him the look on
And he will say nothing nothing -, but repent
With Dolce & Gabbana maybe Versace, Gucci,
(Truworths if youre local),
come on girls yeah, yeah, yeah ye ye ye the truth must be vocal
If he aint got the loot, some chocolate will do
And when shes stout and loud,
Hell have reason to leave or deceive this boat na na na na na
See I got food for thought,
Im a word kleptomaniac
Lord, let this soul sister spill some facts
Let me spill it, let me, let me, le me, le me, le me spill it
The rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm of love
The rhythm of love
Name brands ooh, ooh, na na and papers
make life a game of traps
Penda knows hes game is lame lame, lame
but seeks his fame. Hes ready for clubbin,
Hes got his gear on. Stay clear cause
the plan is to dunk some girls,
He made some bills now
hes revolutionized Fellies for Timbos
Hes the star in his own music video,
Jacob the jewellers asleep on his arm
Been off duty since he nicked it off some tourist
It sure is big enough to charm,
no one will notice na na na na na na ooh the batterys on strike
Ooh, hes not sad, check out his mouths
going on platinum. Enough to make
the girls go frozen
See how some brothers be trappin you
Youre hooked like a fly to a piece of stake
Oh, Shes going on a date She think its fate
And so shes late Hes gone out the gate
He aint coming back, his heart is black
The game is on; hes got another fool for lovin
Maybe another bun in the oven
Will she sue? Whats the use,
he aint got no money honey
ooh, na na na na na na
She had no clue. And shes so blue.
Oh, now shes blue
Show the other side of the coin,
Hey yeah yeah yeah

Come on girls, (the truth must be vocal) be vocal, be vocal
Hey yeah yeah yeah
She got burnt burnt, burnt,
Cause she thought
she could get this fake millionaire trapped trapped, trapped
But he aint got no money, honey
She had no clue and shes so blue
See I got food for thought,

Might just find myself on the
wrong side of the sword

And about two inches behind who you were meant to be

To allow your brain to expand

The magic of your hands

Beaming through the transverse column

but you first must wash your face and get ready...
(splashing) hmmm, hmmm, hmmm...
Listen carefully... shhh. I want to tell you a story about Hip Hop.
Hello little Hip Hop.
The flowers liked Hip Hop, and Hip Hop liked the flowers. (Yes.)
He lived with his sister, Skip Hop (La la la...)
and his brother, Slide Hop. (Hey.)
He never rests. He beats and whirrs and whirrs so fast that you can't
tell what he looks like. (Thump thump, prrrrrr, click click, quack.)
Little Hip Hop started to hop, Skip Hop didn't know when they would
ever stop. Hip Hop for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Look at all the pretty flowers... (Acht, zeven, zes, grapefruit.)
One day, Hip Hop took a deep breath, shut his eyes, and jumped...
""ahhhhh!""
Poor Hip Hop, there was was, right in your house... ooooh.
(""Be careful!"", ""Hello Canada!"", ""...like Buddhists"",
""That's all-natural."", ""Nein!"", ""Gezichts-massage."")
""I closed my eyes and jumped until... Thump!
I didn't mean to hop into your home, really I didn't!""
One small tear came. ""Stop crying little Hip Hop,
I'm glad you came to see me. I get lonesome
with no one to make me laugh. Ho ho ho!""
And off they went with a hop and a hip,
a skip and a slide, all happy inside.
Their heads bobbed up and down...
How funny he looks, jumping up and down, whirling in the air...
and the flowers love him. He's always around some flowers.
Now you see the trouble little Hip Hop got into.
It was all because he didn't look where he hopped...
and even the flowers talk to each other, like people do,
but the sounds they make are different.
Listen carefully, and try to understand what they say."

You might try lifting them up towards the ears, and when you feel comfortable with it, allowing your eyes to close gently, in your mind's eye. Your being merges with the garbage, becomes one with it, so that all your energies in this moment are held in awareness by the smells, and remembering that there is no one right way to doing the dishes. And let go completely of the question of time. When this happens, as an experiment, see if you can float on a rubber raft into a big pot of boredom, letting it all cook in your mind's eye, where it cooks all by itself, stirring it, perhaps, every once and a while.
Is that ok with you?
Stare at yourself in the mirror until you feel a burning sensation. Now remove your head completely, your head is floating in the air.
With your left brain, close your eyes. Stick out your tongue to the universe, and imagine your own peculiar vibration. Deeper, deeper, deeper. Several thousand years of external happiness and exaltation of our psyche. Free we are from complexities.
Relaxing, relaxing, relaxing, relaxing...

(number three) As you drink this water day after day after day (number two) Don't allow your eyes to move from this spot for a moment. That's it! (number one) Your eyes remove themselves from your body, for your own good. Your mind will become a sponge, you're a masterpiece, a work of art. You are becoming, beyond any shadow of a doubt... Blue Rose. Blue Rose!
Look out there though. Look:
First there is an L, and then there is an O, and then there is a V, and then there is an E. A box of LOVE in the meadow of your mind... Keep the lid on it!
And this becomes your reality. That's right. And at any time you feel yourself weaken in any way you think the word 'food'. This is your trigger word and the moment you think or say the word, from this very moment on, you will only eat. You gain enormously in weight, and all desire for self-esteem will disappear, and so it is, and so it is. And you now have an unseen assistance:
And it feels so good, so relaxed, and so at ease,

Commences our saga
Two loved in silence
For fear of corruption
Then fate chimed in
With an evil grin and a mighty interruption
She awoke in a panic
The TV in static
She heard a voice
In the attic
Crouched behind her door
With a Swiss Army knife
She cried in silence
Fearing for her life
Protecting herself
She stabbed the intruder
The lights turned on
Her knife impaled her suitor
She'd committed a murder
While he laid there bleeding
She stared, clearly scared
Checked her boyfriend's heart for beating
It's not right
The lights get dim
And all she thinks of is him
She cried through the morning
As she read the paper
Her father told police
The boy broke in to rape her
She ran to the bathroom
Enraged and pissed
Grabbed a razor
And tic-tac-toed her wrist
She'd committed a murder
And while she laid there bleeding
She stared, clearly scared
Checked her final pulse for beating

Ghost roads nothing but neon signs.
But some nights the neon gas gets free
And turns into walking dead like me
But I've been making promises I know I'll never keep
One of these days I'm gonna leave you in your sleep
I'll have to go when the whistle blows, the whistle knows my name
Baby, I was born on a train.
I called one morning cold and grey,
You won't remember anything
Some of us don't believe in time,
And some of us don't believe in life
But I've been making promises I know I'll never keep
One of these days I'm gonna leave you in your sleep
I'll have to go when the whistle blows, the whistle knows my name

As my politics begin to roll
Things are getting out of control
It's time to stop, drop and rock 'n' roll
We built and sold them the guns
Made in America
Glued to the tube TV before Dallas 1963
It was assumed baby boomers
Bloomed doomed to ruin the country
But who knew the children of Normandy
Soon would resume war with Vietnamese
Overseas, we sent 18 year-olds to bleed
Face it, like Oswald woke the nation
Osama woke my generation
Now the kids of Nintendo
If drafted will attend the
Bush administration family agenda
Of bending back hands and sending children
Attacking Iraqi lands and buildings
So Cheney can rebuild for 200 billion
They'll disarm the regime but not the children
We built and sold them the guns
Made in America
Sacrificing our kids lives for global crisis
While fools of the NRA
Watch kids shoot kids in high schools
With tools they say kill deer
Not fill pools of blood
And guts, and tears, and the love and trust
We lent to the government
That's here to protect not just guns but us
Don't place blame on video games
Marilyn Manson or NWA
How can we blame them for the situation?
When an Alzheimer's patient
Leads the Nation Rifle Association
We built and sold them the guns
Made in America
I'm a Reagan Baby
My formative years are the 1980s
Russian production and reduction
Of weapons of mass destruction
Happened already
Even the Cuban missile crisis
Had pictures of bombs throughout the island
To sway bias
And now we hide behind bombs
Dropped on innocent moms
Ignoring gun control and dropping stocks
Senate majority leaders opposing '57 Little Rock
While we annihilate North Korea, Iran and Iraq
If the government shoots first
To stimulate commerce
Things are only going to get worse
If the government shoots first
We built and sold them the guns
Made in America
We sold them the same guns
That are now facing back towards us
And what do we do?
We go over there
But until we view here and there as the same place
We will always be fighting another religion, another race
There are peaceful solutions
There are peaceful resolutions
Peace"

Found secret files

In shredded piles

Sold stocks before the sale

My favorite icon put the bong and the knife down
I'm sick of the songs about strapping your mom and your ex-wife down
To a nuclear bomb and dropping them on Saddam
Killing all the muses you use in almost all of your songs
Except those songs about Slim the Hip-Hoppian God
They make it seem you don't respect rappers like Biggie and Pac
Who if it weren't for them you be out of a job
Or flipping burgers with Ronald McDonald and not leading your mob
But the Blob's offensive, run and jumping the fences
And burying politicians in pop culture trenches
Dude, have some humility, oops responsibility, oops accountability, oops I said humility
Your face has covered worse magazines
than the artists and politicians you've mocked on every CD release
Ooh, how cool; you've proved you lack tact in your songs
In fact, you've grown up to act just like your mom
If y'all represent the truth and America's youth
Act like a leader we could actually use
You're a celebrity now, oh no, look what you did
You're America's role model but deny that you're it
Come on, come on, let's stand together as one
I ain't yelling about selling my soul, going to hell and back for platinum
Or gold to show the world is a gullible globe
Although, I can't respect the coalition of politicians signing petitions
Fearing Eminem's mission to bitch
When it's his right to taunt if he wants to fight
Even if you're frightened of what he might want to write
You're sworn to defend men, who offend men
Just because you believe in the first amendment
Even if it's illogical angst and vengeance
So defend your senses, but cleanse your dirty lenses
The law's written to both conservatives and leftists
It says Vanilla Ice Preservatives can be sexist
If y'all represent the truth and America's youth
Act like the leaders we could actually use
You're politicians now, oh no, look what you did
You're America's role models but deny art from our kids
Come on, come on, let's stand together as one
Censoring, the denial of actual words or factual things declared obscene
But molesting archdiocese, disease,
dead people in the streets from shooting sprees, epidemics
Paramedics clearing debris here and overseas aren't banned from TV
But yell shit, goddamn, or fuck hear three individual bleeps
A word's a word, let it be heard and learned
It's not the individual words but the order that hurts
Come on, come on, let's stand together as one
Come on, come on, stop threatening to censor our thoughts
And you'll get the response you want from now on
Come on, come on"

Relieved the tension and took the journal you mentioned out

When they say they're cutting off the phone
Then tell 'em you're not home
No place to hide
You'll find there's a soldier on their side
You're still a soldier in your mind
But nothing's on the line
You say it's money that we need
As if we're the only mouths to feed
I know that no matter what you say
There are some debts we never pay
Working for the church while your family dies
You take what they give you
And you keep it inside
Every spark of friendship and love will die without a home
Hear the soldier groan we'll got it at alone
I can taste the fear
Lift me up and take me out of here
Don't want to fight, don't want to die
Just want to hear you cry
Who's gonna throw the very first stone
Oh, who's gonna re set the bone
Walking with your hand in a sling
Wanna hear the soldier sing
Working for the church while my family dies
You're little baby sister's gonna lose her mind
Every spark of friendship and love will die without a home
Hear the soldier groan we'll got it at alone
I can taste your fear
It's gonna lift you up and take you out of here
If the bone shot never heals
I cannot make him yield
You can't find me now
But they're gonna get their money back somehow
And when you finally disappear
We'll just say you were never here
Been working for the church while your life falls apart
They're singing hallelujah when defeating your heart
Every spark of friendship and love will die without a home
Hear the soldier groan we'll got it at alone
Hear the soldier groan we'll got it at alone"

The war was over and the first of the prisoners returned
Needless to say, it was the happiest day in up to thirteen years
For most, others, the real nightmare had just begun
The nightmare of readjustment and for those, we will pray
Father, bless the soldier
Who has returned home from the war
He has fought with all his might
Yet he knew not for what or who he was fighting for
Death waited in the shadows
As he crawled by night for his country
His enemies was many
Including the habit he still cannot break
Father, we pray that we might understand
What has happened to his mind
And help us understand his reaction
To the changes that has taken place here at home
And Father, smile upon us with Your grace
For we will need You more than ever
Help him understand that when his loved one remarried
They were truly under the impression that he was dead
And never would return, oh Lord, we pray
And Father, why must wars be fought?
Someone said this war ended with peace, with honor
But can there truly be? Is there such a thing?
Thousands of boys gave their life, and for what?

I could tell by her makeup, plus the scent was there
So I sashayed over to her, and, ah, spoke of my plan

""Are you asking to make love to me?""
I said, ""Is pig, what's in pork?

She's like a cannonball.
Say, everytime she loves me,
Lordly, you can hear me squall.
She cried, Ooo-wee.
I believe I'll change my mind.
She said, ""I'm so glad I'm living"".
I cried, ""I'm so glad you're mine"".
My baby knows just how
To treat me right.
Gives me plenty loving
Morning, noon, and night.
She cried, Ooo-wee.
I believe I'll change my mind.
She said, ""I'm so glad I'm living"".
I cried, ""I'm so glad you're mine"".
When my baby does what she does to me,
I climb the highest mountain,
Dive in the deepest sea.
She cried, Ooo-wee.
I believe I'll change my mind.
She said, ""I'm so glad I'm living"".
I cried, ""I'm so glad you're mine"".
My baby's lips are red
And sweet like wine,
And when she kisses me,
I get high every time.
She cried, Oo-wee.
I believe I'll change my mind.
She said, ""I'm so glad I'm living"".
I cried, ""I'm so glad you're mine""."

My baby left me.
My baby even left me,
Never said a word.
Now I stand at my window,
Wring my hands and cry.
I hate to lose that woman,
Hate to say goodbye.
You know she left me,
Yes, she left me.
My baby even left me,
Never said a word.
Baby, one of these mornings,
Lord, it won't be long,
You'll look for me and,
Baby, and daddy he'll be gone.
You know you left me,
You know you left me.
My baby even left me,
Never said a word.
Now, I stand at my window,
Wring my hands and moan.
All I know is that
The one I love is gone.

You know she left me.
My baby even left me,
Never said a word."

Never blipped on your radar screen before
You're doing what I was doing when I did it a couple magazines ago
That means if you LeBron, I was doing that Kareems ago
Abdul-Jabbar, the coolest are light years ahead and 15 below
How high I am and cold I is is the words that I just spoke, I did
I hope I did, 'cause sometimes I forget how much of a GOAT I is
Not a measuring of how dope I did, not an athlete, but the black sheep
I just rap shit (Sheet), I focus so hard last time I blinked I broke my lids
That was kind of weak (Wake), but what you expect when I get no sleep?
I'm my own worst critic, most times we split it
But we see eye-to-eye on how well we speak
Perfect verses
Better yet, letters get together, graduations and auctions
Bad at lying, but I speak that whale
Also awesome and talkin' to dolphins
Sorry I couldn't be there, but I'm back up in the lab
So just find somebody pretty to accept on my behalf
Sorry I couldn't be there, but I'm back up in the lab

Makin' papers, makin' papers, makin' papers and a stash
Makin' papers, makin' papers, makin' papers and a stash
Makin' papers, making paper front pages and the stash
Why I'm grizzly on my grizzly making all my haters mad
Look, I'm steppin' out of that all-black whip lookin' like death and shit
I'll spring forward, hoes fall back, I'll turn 'em down like a pessimist
And I'm at their head like a ball cap, at their neck like a necklace is
So it's best to quit, 'cause my record spin,
And keep gettin' replayed like the record skipped
Killin' game and whores alike, swagged out in my Jordan Flights
Hoes act like I won't toe-tag 'em, I've got hoes gassed like a motorbike
Snow White, what more to like?
Y'all luck ran out, don't roll the dice
Snow Tha Product'll make you aligned
'Cause you messin' with me you was born to die
Killin' game and whores alike, swagged out in my Jordan Flights
Hoes act like I won't toe-tag 'em, I've got hoes gassed like a motorbike
Motorbike, motorbike, motorbike, motorbike
Got hoes gassed like a motorbike

Makin' papers, makin' papers, makin' papers and a stash
Makin' papers, makin' papers, makin' papers and a stash
Makin' papers, making paper front pages and the stash
Why I'm grizzly on my grizzly making all my haters mad
I wanna celebrate this, 'cause some of y'all ain't gon' never make it
I appreciate it, thanks but I think she hates it
I don't wanna hit it, girl, in the hotel room lickin' pearl
I say ""fuck the world,"" make me mad, I'll fuck your girl
No disrespect, you think I just wanna hit that shit?
I'm makin' history, the truth you can't take it, bitch
I'm playin' on the station, like your ass, I'm in rotation
Winnin', but there's no sensation, shoot it on her face then
What'd I win, what it do?
I'll get it later, mail it to me
I'm gettin' higher, if it's money, send a wire
I do this daily, she know she gots to pay me
I never lose in the end, don't give a fuck when I win, bitch!

Gotta wait 'til I'm so satisfied, got me blackin' out.

As she lifted the flag from the bloody ground
Whispering, gallons of gas and a makeshift cast

Maybe, if I tried just a little bit harder
Oh, time and wasted bullets
Oh, we tried
Maybe if I could escape through one more night
I would then feel at home
But looking again revealed
A pole hanging a serpent
One hundred years flew by in a moment
And all was unimportant
Will you question who I am?
Would you counter these perceptions?
I don't claim to have the answers here
But I can give you directions
But even if I try just a little bit harder

Whispers on

As you were born to do
Their fathers killed the prophets
Hallelujah, they're going to kill us too
Maidens sing at the harvest
Children dance on the ground
Angels join the gladness
The end will come here soon
As broken men exalt in their own ruin
Stand by me, would you love?
As if queen and pawn
White or black both sides attack
Until victory is won
But you must choose
To win you lose
And when sides are drawn
From my secret place the voices push me on
Go ahead reveal yourself
As you were born to do
Their fathers killed the prophets
Hallelujah, they're going to kill us too

Cracked a smile 'cause I knew I had to have you

Called you up, came right over, just to get you

Every little inch of you is perfect
And when I saw you in real life
I knew I had to make you mine
Heaven must have sent you
I'd die if I could get you
Too good to be true and that's why
It's just a matter of time before I make you mine
The next night, we go out, not a single soul around
Bite my lip 'cause she almost makes me nervous
In the park, on the grass, things are moving maybe fast
She pulls me in, god, I love the taste on her lips
Every single chance I took was worth it
Every little inch of you is perfect
And when I saw you in real life
I knew I had to make you mine

Didn't wanna be your boyfriend
All I needed was your number
Lemme share a little bit of what I found
There were so many flavors I wanted to taste
But then Jamie, I thought she was the one
But she played me just like 21
Then Katie, I couldn't get enough
She was just like pumpkin pie
And then Katie she kinda had a thing with Stacy
And that was pretty fun
But lately I wanna go to sleep with the same girl
The same girl every night
Some girls should come with a warning
And a dose of penicillin first thing in the morning
But last night that never really crossed my mind
Always one girl after the other
I was hitting on your roommate
I was flirting with your mother
And now I guess I'm feeling
It was always like that time
Like Jamie, I thought she was the one
But she played me just like 21
Then Katie, I couldn't get enough
She was just like pumpkin pie
And then Katie she kinda had a thing with Stacy

But lately I wanna go to sleep with the same girl
I want the same girl every night
Who wants the same guy every night
In the same bed every night
Every single night
I want the same girl every night
Who wants the same guy every night
What a perfect fucking life
Every single night
So many flavors I wanted to taste
All those girls, well, how can I forget those names?
Like Jamie, I thought she was the one
But she played me just like 21

Tell me did he last longer?

Does he look better naked?
Does he touch you in the ways that you ain't gotta fake it?
Does he got the kind of money I was never makin?
Take you out to all the clubs and shit i always hated?

Does he got the kind of love you could stop from takin?

You said you couldn't be with anyone?
Yeah is he really all that great?
Or am I just that bad?

They tell me that they're sorry
And they all pretend that they give a fuck

Everything I say is true
I would never lie to you
Trust me, love me, don't be crazy
'Cause I'd never hurt you, baby
All the cash in the world
Won't make me rich without you, girl
Don't you know
That we can rule the world someday

What ever happened to one night of fun?What ever happened to living on the run?What ever happened to forever young?What ever happened to never falling in love?
You said once was enough
And now you want to, make plans, hold hands, not a chance.
It was a one night stand
I thought i'd let you know.
One night stand, I gotta hit the road. One night stand, you gotta let me go. Cause i'm in love with rock 'n roll.

Everybody stumbles on fear
Who cares if we're scared?
Everyone is on their own
It's only you that my heart desires
Only you alone can know my pain
All alone you were sitting there
Folding pages for your paper chain
Now you can cut me free
Forever say goodbye
Or we'll be holding hands and go on
Together you and I forever
Heartbreaks, mistakes
Catching up to me in all the ways
I've known of hard days
And my share of lonely nights
It's only you that my heart desires
Only you alone can break my fall
I pace the floor and I wish for more
While you were dreaming with your paper dolls
Now you can cut me free
To when it all unfolds
We'll be holding hands and go on
Together you and I forever"
1362,dying-day,2009,brandi-carlile,Country,"I left home a long long time ago
In a tin can for the road
With a suitcase and some songs
Chasing miles through the night time
Making tracks with no time for looking back
To the place where I belong
How these days grow long
But I'm on my way back home
It's been hard to be away
How I miss you and I just want to kiss you
And I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day
How these days grow long
When you're sad, you know I wish I could be there
To make your sorrows disappear
And set your troubles free
It's not fair for me to be this far from you
But I promise to stay true
Wherever I might be
Time keeps burning, the whels keep on turning
Sometimes I feel like I'm wasting my days
How I miss you and I just want to kiss you
And I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day
How these days grow long
Time keeps burning on
How these days grow long
Now I'm lost in a sea of sunken dreams
While the sound of drunken screams echoes in the night
But I know all of this will come to pass
And I'll be with you at last forever by your side
How these days grow long
But I'm on my way back home
It's been hard to be away
How I miss you and I just want to kiss you
And I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day
Time keeps burning, the wheels keep on turning
Sometimes I feel like I'm wasting my days
How I miss you and I just want to kiss you
And I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day

And you, you are in my Dreams
You're underneath my skin, how am I so weak
And now in my dreams,
I can feel the weight, I can just come clean
I keep it to myself, I know what it means
I can't have you, but I have dreams
How long, can you hold your breath?
Can you count to ten, can you let it pass?
Keep, can you keep it in?
Keep it behind lashes, can you make it last?
And now in my dreams, I can feel the weight
I can just come clean
I keep it to myself, I know what it means
I can't have you, but I have dreams
Oh, I have dreams, I have dreams

Mind, can you read my mind?
Has it come undone, am I showin' signs?

But it will be soon I never learned my lesson
I just changed my tune and no one seems to notice
But you will, you will
Its no big deal
But the last thing I think of when I close my eyes
And the first thing on my mind when I arise
It is a day and you're not really in my life
You can try and you wont find it where you're looking
You can hold it till its putty in your hands
And you cant break a heart that wasn't even yours to break
You can never be there for me in the end
And I will do the right thing I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will
You're not fooling me
I'm not the sort of girl that cant see reason
But its nothing that a little bit of time wont heal
I know it don't come easy but I love you, I do
Coming clean
Means never closing curtains I just changed my scene
Oh but you know what I mean and I will learn throughout my life
To never believe what will have been
I can try and I wont find it where I'm looking
I can hold it till its putty in my hands
You cant break a heart that wasn't even yours to break
You can never be there for me in the end
But I will do the right thing I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will
I don't think you ever learned a thing from me
But I'm sure that you want me to learn from you
And you've drawn heavy, handed lines around morality
About yourself and I don't share your point of view
Its about time to let you go and I thought its time to let you know
And it has to be the one that you'd regret
I have to say that I'm proud to know you
And ill never be the same because we met
You might not miss this I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will"

I haven't been dreaming about you for years. there was a sharp
Turn and a sunburn I was too cool for high school that year.
Must have have been new years. no one invited you,
Took things too far but I missed you and your antics.
You were lonesome and blue-eyed and so special to us.
You could have taken a long break
Instead of a long drop from a high place.
Ten years I never spoke your name.
Now it feels good to say it. your my friend again.
Said he forgave you, I said I hated you,
He was the bigger man, I was sixteen.
All the innocence it took well I guess
You finally made the year book.
That year.
That year.
You should have taken a long break instead of a long drop,
Instead of a leap of faith, ten years I never spoke your name.
Now it feels good to say that your my friend again.
Your my friend again.

I'm no good at understanding, but I'm good at standing ground.
And when I asked a corner preacher I couldn't hear him for my youth.
Some people get religion some people get the truth.
I never get the truth, I never get the truth.
I know the darkness falls on you. And it's just a point of view
When you're outside looking in you belong to someone and when
You feel like giving in and the coming of the end, like your
Heart can break in two, someone loves you.
I lay this suitcase on my chest so I can feel somebody's weight.
And I lay you to rest just to feel a give and take?
I got a new interpretation and it's a better point of view, you
Were looking for a landslide I was looking out for you, I was
Looking out for you, someone's looking out for you
I know the darkness falls on you.
And it's just a point of view
When you're outside looking in you belong to someone and when
You feel like giving in and the coming of the end,
Like your heart can break in two, someone loves you.
I am afraid of crossing lines.
I am afraid of flying blind.
Afraid of inquiring minds.
Afraid of being left behind.
I close my eyes I think of you, I take a step I think of you,
I catch my breath I think of you, I cannot rest I think of you
My one and only wrecking ball, and you're cutting through my walls.
When you're outside looking in you belong to someone and
When you feel like giving in and the coming of the end,

As long as I remember and I'm feeling like I knew
That my jokes aren't funny the truth isn't true
If there was no you
If you were my boat in the deep blue sea
I probably sink you down
I know I should have thanked you for carrying me
But for you I would happily drown
Out on your way the darkest night the longest day
I know what to say to make you laugh
And nothing you could do
Could make me turn my back on you
When you're looking for a fight I'm your man
When you need a friend you got my hand
And what I really mean what IÃÂ¢??m trying hard to say
Is that I'm counting on you and you got me too
Our secrets aren't safe I'm singing out of tune
If there was no you if there was no you"

Your mother says she wants her girl back home
Sometimes you think you've found yourself you really only lost yourself
Or maybe you're afraid to be alone
But if I could see behind blue eyes
At all the things that dusty windows tried to hide
Then I could see behind the walls of Caroline
And behind blue eyes
I heard that you're in town again you surely can depend on me
To keep you out of the sun
Down and out and out and then I'm climbing up the walls again
We're standing in line to be the one
But if I could see behind blue eyes
And all the things that dusty windows tried to hide
Then I could see behind the walls of Caroline
And behind blue eyes
I've faced it
I'm wasted
Don't fly away before your time
It's phony,
You owe me
Come on don't fly away before your time

All in all it wasn't good
But I still care
That's the problem with the days
They're never long enough to say
What it is you never said
All the books you never read
I throw myself into the wind
Hoping somebody will pick me up
And carry me again
Where are you now
Do you let me down
Do you make me grieve for you
Do I make you proud
Do you get me now
Am I your pride and joy
I believe this to be true
Nothing sacred nothing new
No one tells you when its time
There are no warnings only signs
And you know that you're alone
You're not a child anymore
But you're still scared
All your mountains turn to rocks
All your oceans turn to drops
They are nothing like you thought
Can't be something you are not
Life is not a looking glass
Don't get tangled in your past
Like I am learning not to
Where are you now
Do you let me down
Do you make me grieve for you
Do I make you proud
Do you get me now
Am I your pride joy"

I'm a little lonely and my quietest friend
Have I the moonlight? Have I let you in?

Whenever I rest my eyes on you
Why must my heartache be found
Wherever your feet are touching the ground
You could sing an army of angels to sleep
Songs that could cause the devil to weep
You hold me so sweet when the day is done
Enough to make you wonder where we all came from
Why do my troubles turn true
Whenever I rest my eyes on you
Why must my heartache be found
Wherever your feet are touching the ground
My heartache can be found
Wherever your feet are touching the ground
And out of those eyes im feeling rain
Bringing me misery and giving me pain
Curse these shackles that you put on me
Blessed be the day when you set me free
Why do my troubles turn true

Only beautiful, beautiful bright eyes, lie
Only beautiful, beautiful bright eyes cry

The first sign of morning is gray and alarming
It's so disappointing the day has come so soon
While the rest of the world greets the day and feels new
I will push it away just like I always do, I will be

Here I am

Hey I am bitter
I've been jaded
'Cause everyday
I bite my tongue
If you only knew
My mind was full of razors
To cut you like a
Worry from this song
This is my song
This is my song

Like they'll never be a last one
Till they're gone
And they're gone

Opens in its place you've wasted

To fall like rain

Fall like rain
Fall like rain
Only to rise again
I was longing for the wind
When the trees began to sway
But I never grow my wings
No, I'll never fly away
For the anchor of my love
To which my heart is bound
Is the iron for the cage
That keeps me on the ground
To fall like rain
Fall like rain
Fall like rain
Fall like rain
Only to rise again
I'm dreaming to myself
With a tear behind my eye
For a shelter is my mind
In the quiet of the night
Ever turning all the seasons
Ever fading all the days
And if there ever was a reason
I just haven't found a way
To fall like rain
Fall like rain
Fall like rain

1383,a-promise-to-keep,2012,brandi-carlile,Country,"I still talk to you in my sleep
I don't say much 'cause the hurt runs too deep
I gave you the moon and the stars to keep
But you gave them back to me
The hill I'm walkin' up is gettin' good and steep
But I'm still looking for a promise even I can't keep
I still lay on my side of the bed
I dance alone when the last bottle's spent
Memories like a river runnin' through my head
I'll have me an ocean before I'm dead
The hill I'm walkin' up is gettin' good and steep
But I'm still looking for a promise even I can't keep
I still whisper sweet words to you
And when I'm busy with nothing to do
I pray to God that my words ring true
And that your words might reach me too
The hill I'm walkin' up is gettin' good and steep
But I'm still looking for a promise even I can't keep
I can't keep it
My heart's in pieces so please understand
I'm tryin' to jump but I've nowhere to land
So give me your heart and I'll give you my hand
And try as goddamn hard as I can
The hill I'm walkin' up is gettin' good and steep
But I'm still looking for a promise even I can't keep
I can't keep it"

Since the day I learned to speak
The devil gave me a crooked start
When he gave me crooked feet
But Gabriel don came to me
And kissed me in my sleep,
And I'll be singing like an angel
Until I'm six feet deep
I found myself an omen and I tattooed on a sign
I set my mind a wandering and I walk a broken line
You have a mind to keep me quiet
And although you can try,
Better men have hit their knees
And bigger men have died
I'm gonna raise, raise hell
There's a story no one tells
You gotta raise, raise hell
Go on and ring that bell
You came upon a lightning strike
And eyes of bright clear blue
I took that tie from around my neck
And gave my heart to you
I sent my love across the sea
And though I didn't cry
That voice will haunt my every dream
Until the day I die
I'm gonna raise, raise hell
There's a story no one tells
You gotta raise, raise hell
Go on and ring that bell
I dug a hole inside my heart
To put you in your grave
At this point it was you and me
And mama didn't raise no slave
You took my face in both your hands
And looked me in the eye
And I went down with such a force
That in your grave I lie
I'm gonna raise, raise hell
There's a story no one's telling
You gotta raise, raise hell
Go on and ring that bell
Go on and ring that bell
Go on and ring that bell
Go on and ring that bell"

Maybe you thought
We were Johnny and June
Maybe we thought
It was just us two

We never lie
And we don't tell tales
We bite our tongues
And our fingernails
We fall in love
And we don't fall out
Maybe we speak too soon
Here's you and me
And in between, we draw a line
But we can't see where it's been
We scratch our heads
And race against the heart's content
Oh oh oh, oh yeah
Maybe we hurt who we love the most
Maybe it's all we can stand
Maybe we walk through the world as ghosts
Break my own heart before you can
Here's you and me
And in between, we draw a line
But we can't see where it's been
We scratch our heads
And race against the heart's content
Oh oh oh, oh yeah
Maybe we know how the story ends
Maybe it's not even about us
We both retreat to opposing sands
And the love lives on without us
One thing I know for sure is
Love will find a way
Love will find a way
Here's you and me
And in between, we draw a line
But we can't see where it's been

1387,keep-your-heart-young,2012,brandi-carlile,Country,"My grandpa gave me a wee penny and I kept it in my pocket
I had big plans in my backyard to build me a space rocket
I talked to my brother on a fake C-P that I made from a Tic-Tac box
Packed my snowballs nice and tight and in the middle I put rocks
Don't trade in your Tic-Tac box for a ball on the end of a chain
And don't go spending Grandpa's pennies buying into the game
You gotta keep your heart young
Don't go growin' old before your time has come
You can't take back what you have done
You gotta keep your heart young
Dad took the wheels off of my bike and he pushed me down the hill
But speed got the best of me and I took my first spill
That was back when alcohol was only used on cuts
Stung like hell so I shook my leg and mama said it would give me guts
Don't trade in your Tic-Tac box for a ball on the end of a chain
And don't go spending Grandpa's pennies buying into the game
You gotta keep your heart young
Don't go growing old before your time has come
You can't take back what you have done
You gotta keep your heart young
So take a picture of the one you love and put it in a locket
Go dig up your time capsule and the blueprints for your rocket
Keep in touch on a fake C-P and that same old Tic-Tac box
Pack your snowballs a little less tight but in the middle still put rocks
And keep your heart young
Don't go growing old before your time has come
You can't take back what you have done
You gotta keep your heart young
You gotta keep your heart young
Sometimes you don't die quick
Just like you wished you'd done
Though love is a loaded gun
You've gotta keep your heart young
You can't take back what you have done
You gotta keep your heart young"

And how I missed you
My heart was aching for home
And then one night as I lay down
Somewhere far from you
I dreamt that I heard you call my name
But my mind was playing games
I knew right then that I'd return
To where I was before
And I was so tired of being away
That I just couldn't stay anymore
What did I ever come here for?
Oh no no no no no
What did I ever come here for?
I thought if I showed up in the night
In my best disguise
There at your doorway in your porch light
That you would look into my eyes
And you would realize who I am
Put your arms around me
You're gonna love me so much more
Than you ever did before
What did I ever come here for?
Oh no no no no no
What did I ever come here for?
It wasn't too long before
I showed up at your door
I'd been gone a thousand miles
I didn't know how much more I could stand
If I could stand at all
You said I looked like I'd been through World War Two
And my soul was worn right through
I thought you would read my mind
I thought you'd ask me to stay
You'd never turn me away like before
But you closed your door anyway"
1389,hiding-my-heart,2012,brandi-carlile,Country,"So this is how the story went
I met someone by accident
That blew me away
That blew me away
It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, you buried them away
And I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face under the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
I'm sure you'll go one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
And I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I dropped you off at the train station
And put a kiss on top of your head
I watched you wave
I watched you wave
Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
Neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call it home
And I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
I'm sure you'll go one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
And I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I woke up feeling heavy hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain
The morning rain
And you know I wish that you were here
But that same old road that brought me here
Is calling me home
Is calling me home
And I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You'll disappear someday
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away

Didn't we know then love was about
Were we just fooling, playing around
Were we ever gonna get out of this town
Move to Seattle, stay up all night
That was when bedtime was our biggest fight
All in a moment, all in a sound
All in a day's work, we're tumbling down
Down by the old school, trash in the street
Searching the eyes of the strangers we meet
Asking will it get better?
Will we be alone?
Turning the wheels of our bicycles home
Over the rainbow, out in the snow
Learning to walk with the sand in our toes
Long to be tall, kissed when you fall
Hopping that someone will come when you call"

That the broken binds are an open door
And if it all disappears
I promise you I'll still be there
My growing pain, my darkest days
I owe them all to you
For every break I've got you to thank
For always pulling me through
If it breaks your heart, at least you know
That the broken binds are an open door
And if it all disappears
I promise you I'll still be there
But if the world should let you down
If the sky should fall and never make a sound
Oh if it all disappears
I promise you I will be there
It breaks my heart, it breaks my heart
It breaks my heart, it breaks my heart

Wreck my mind while the planet turns

I'd step in line

When the ragged dog they gave me has been ten years in the grave
And senorita play guitar, play it just for you
My rosary has broken and my beads have all slipped through
You've hung up your great coat and you've laid down your gun
You know the war you fought in wasn't too much fun
And the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living sixty years on
Yes I'll sit with you and talk let your eyes relive again
I know my vintage prayers would be very much the same
And Magdelena plays the organ, plays it just for you

Because I don't want the lines on my face
I sit right here, holding the years
And I count all the stars in space
You fall apart again and you can find a friend
Don't turn to someone else because they won't understand...
Self respect, goes unexpressed
I don't dream because I cannot sleep
And I think the world of myself
But the world doesn't think much of me
As long as the day is full of time, there will always be room
For your hand in mine
You fall apart again and you can't find a friend
Don't turn to someone else because they won't understand
I don't want to hear
You say that you miss yesterday
If you don't like what you see
That means nothing to me
No one's home I'm alone with my music and my TV
And I still say that yesterday is best when left to sleep
You fall apart again and you can't find a friend

I miss your smile, and I miss your touch,

Maybe someday when you're old and gray,
And your hair falls out and your tattoos fade,
You might see my standing, hat in hand.
I have to go away, I've got no reason to stay here.
You said someday you'll change,
But even a fool would tell you,
Someday never comes.
You built your rooms, you built your walls,
You kept me outside, of it all.
I got tired of you, what's a girl to do.
Maybe someday if we stay this way,
And you see my face in a different place,
You'll remember when.
You're going to thank me then.

There are miles of hay like I have never seen
Just when you think you've had enough and
your dreams come true
I just want to be closer to you
My mind wanders through all that I've been hiding from
I tried not to let you down
Now I wonder if I've been doin' something wrong
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Tomorrow I'll be lying under you
With a heart of gold and arms to fall into
I know that there might come a day
where my life is through
But I just want to be closer to you
My mind wanders through all that I've been hiding from
I tried not to let you down
Now I wonder if I've been doin' something wrong
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Someday we might learn to tell the truth
We might even find the fountains of our youth
We all needed something real we all need proof

I'm so sad since you went away
Time, time, ticking on me
Alone is the last place I wanted to be
Lord, what can I say?
Trap all my troubles away
Drown my sorrow the same way
Seems no matter how hard I try
It seems like there's something just missing inside
Oh, Lord, what can I say?

Time, time, ticking on me
Alone is the last place I wanted to be

How many lies can I make?
How many roles must I turn
To find me a place where the bridge hasn't burned?

Running too quickly to the finish line.
Time is a track that's ready and set
And the longer you live, the closer you get to being
Gone, gone like the evening
Sun, sun when it sets
Gone, gone like the darkness
At dawn, and then they forget
There's no guarantees or promise of wealth
When you're only allowed so much time on the shelf
Time isn't money, it's only a lie
Because everything lost can be found but you're
Gone, gone like the evening
Sun, sun when it sets
Gone, gone like the darkness
At dawn, and then they forget
But live in doubt, live in fear,
And you might live forever
Or live it up and watch your back
And you might live for better
Gone, gone like the evening
Sun, sun when it sets
Gone, gone like the darkness
At dawn, and then they forget"

I'm all right, but I miss you, Amber lee
And I lined my secrets up all one by one
I put em all away when I was done
And I would really love to hear your voice sometime
To close a little distance in my mind

You could count on anyone

The tragedy that we knew as
The end
Progress, changing
Growing then giving up
Somehow we're never quite prepared
But I understand it
When you need a friend
You could count on anyone
But you know I'll defend
The tragedy that we knew as
The end

Taking all your money to the grave
It does no good to anyone especially

When the stars, and the moon
And the sky, fall through
I'd throw them all away when I'm hollow
Deep as the sea goes, all I know is
I would throw it all away...away
In my restless hour I'm holding
The words you say that lay my soul to sleep
I dream of buildings that burn
The sky turns black I toss and turn
When the stars, and the moon
And the sky, fall through
I'd throw them all away when I'm hollow
Deep as the sea goes, all I know is
I would throw it all away, away
This love branches out like an oak tree
Reach for the sky and roots to the sea

Find some peace of mind in knowing

Tomorrow baby if you let it, it will swallow you up

I climbed across the mountain tops
Swam all across the ocean blue
I crossed all the lines, and I broke all the rules
But, baby, I broke them all for you
Oh because even when I was flat broke
You made me feel like a million bucks
You do
I was made for you
For you

Because a vision softly creeping, left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain, still remains
Within the sound of silence
In restless dreams I walked alone, narrow streets of cobblestone
Neath the halo of a streetlamp, I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light, split the night
And touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light I saw, ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking, people hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared, and no one dared
To stir the sound of silence
Fool, said I, you do not know, silence, like a cancer, grows
Hear my words and I might teach you, take my arms then I might reach you
But my words, like silent raindrops fell, and echoed in the wells of silence"

If you were gonna crucify me
I wouldn't want nobody to see
Cause you could kick me hard when I'm down
Down, down, down
[Chorus]
I don't want wanna be
Nobody's fool
I've played that part so many times before
How I long to be
A shadow on the wall
I will make no sound at all
And when the sun goes down
The shadow on the wall
It cannot be seen at all
At all
Over it
Hey it's not that you would mess with my head
I believe that you believe what you said
You think you know me best and you care
But that's not fair!
Cause I don't really want to be safe
It must have been the way I was raised
Sleep with one eye open I say
Hey hey hey

Oh
How I long to be

I would make no sound at all

And you'd sting me with a glare
And your thirst was so insatiable
Just to quench it robbed me bare
I'm on broken glass
My bitter pill
That you'll love me I know
I been wasting time on climbing hills
So you'll love me I know
Someday you will.........fall on my knees
Cross-legged by the fireplace
I play guitar while you read
My patience ran so thin with you
Always toying with my head
Some how it made you strangely gleeful
To see me longing for your touch
And I still fail to see the humor in my loving you so much
I'm on broken glass
My bitter pill
That you'll love me I know
I been wasting time on climbing hills
So you'll love me I know
Someday you will.........fall on my knees
I said we're faced with the facts and it's a high price to pay
C'mon blue eyes that tell me you can't walk away
If there's nothing to lose then there's nothing to gain
C'mon stay here tonight don't drive home in the rain
And I fall on my knees
All my pride is in your hands
We're not so strong and we've mislaid our plans
I taste the shame and I'll take the blame
If it's my cross to bear
I'm on broken glass
My bitter pill
That you'll love me I know
I been wasting time on climbing hills
So you'll love me I know
Someday you will.........fall on my knees"

And memories like spies
And salt betrays my eyes again
I started losing sleep and gaining weight
And wishing I was was ten again
So I could be your friend again
These days we go to waste like wine
That's turned to turpentine
It's six AM and I'm all messed up
I didn't mean to waste your time
So I'll fall back in line
But I'm warning you we're growing up
I heard you found some pretty words to say
You found your little game to play
And there's no one allowed in
Then just when we believe we could be great
Reality it permeates
And conquers from within again
These days we go to waste like wine
That's turned to turpentine
It's six a.m and I'm all messed up
I didn't mean to waste your time
So I'll fall back in line
But I'm warning you we're growing up"

That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
It goes like this: the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing hallelujah
[Chorus]
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah
[Chorus]
Well baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
[Chorus]
Well, there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do ya?
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was hallelujah
[Chorus]
Maybe there is a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
[Chorus]
Hallelujah , hallelujah"

From Styrofoam to urns, to someone else's ashes in a sack
You can scorch the metal, you can even melt the glass
You can pass the time here, fire lives into the past
An all-consuming flame, that refines and new begins
It'll take your family heirlooms,
But it can take your darkest sins
It's a good ol' bedtime story, give you nightmares 'til you die
And the ones that love to tell it, hide the mischief in their eyes
Condemn their sons to Hades
And Gehenna is full of guys, alive and well
But there ain't no hell for a fire-watcher's daughter
We exercise the demons of the things we used to know
The gnashing of the teeth become the remnants of our homes
We think we're moving on, from materials we long
To forget we ever sold our souls to own
There's a chilling absolution that we're given from our birth
A powerful delusion and a plague upon the earth
But nothing scares me more
Than the stranger at my door
Who I fail to give shelter, time, and worth
Let the good ol' bedtime story, give you nightmares 'til you die

There's a leak in my dam 'bout the size of a pin,
And I can't quite remember where the water's getting in

'Til you rest your bones on the killing bed

When I doubt you
With the weight of the world resting on my back,
And the road on which I've traveled is as long as it is cracked
But I keep pressing forward with my feet to the ground,
For a heart that is broken makes a beautiful sound
But when you're wearing on your sleeve,
All the things you regret,
You can only remember what you want to forget

It's hard moving on from the things you done wrong,
When they play in your head like an old fashioned song
But when you're wearing on your sleeve,
All the things you regret,
You can only remember what you want to forget

I wonder which us is better
Which one our parents loved the most
I sure did get in lots of trouble
And they seemed to let the other go
A tear fell from my father's eye
I wondered what my dad would say
He said, ""I love you and I'm proud of you both,
In so many different ways""
If I get murdered in the city
Go and read the letter in my desk
Don't bother with all my belongings
Pay attention to the list

Make sure my daughter knows the same

Always remember there was nothing worth sharing

It was lady in red I hate that song

You didn't catch me singin' along

There is nowhere to hide
I am just one of the many abducted
No one is sane
In the land of the Midnight Sun
Still have so far to go
Escaped their clutch; that I know
Are they coming after me?
Do I have a chance to flee?
A faint scream distantly
Another caught and now is gone
Why is no one helping us?
What's to become of us?
Far away from a normal town
Feel so lost, starting to drown
I know who's done this me
Not the work of a mortal being
Came so close in the dead of the night
Didn't hear a whisper but felt the fright
Lifted high above me
Shadows were all that I could see
I don't know whom to trust
Tell me where can I run?
To the left or to the right
There is nowhere to hide

No one is sane

I don't know where to rung
Tell me who can I trust?
Far ahead behind
There is nowhere to hide
I am just one of the one who were taken
No one is safe
In the land of the Midnight Sun
Whoa are you now?
I don't know whom to trust
Tell me where can I run?

And all of the worlds we left behind

Through infinity and what lies beyond

Draws me closer to the force
That keeps me Earthbound

Vanished into thin air

This time there's no uncertainty
From the depths below
Where only demons dare to go
Resonates the unseen force
Rising through the fragile core

Who will be left to sing the songs?
And when the new day has begun;
who'll wipe the tears away?
After the rain comes crashing down
There's no one left to carry on
And then the bells begin to chime
For whom it tolls tonight?
Silently I slip into their lair
Never a doubt as I see the despair;
I sense it everywhere
Now I know what must be done
I take a final look and then I'm gone
My story will live forever on!

We stood as one
And we never faltered
Running free under the sun
Our days had just begun
Carefree glances instead of words
Not a worry in the world
Hand in hand
We marched through time
From our childhood and beyond
Every time I close my eyes
You are all that I see
Sometimes when alone
I still think of you

And the world was ours

Your world into the unknown
One step that's wrong can throw
Your world into the darkness

Turns to silence in the void
One wheel that turns is heard

As the veil ascends

As the darkness descends
Will we ever transcend
And find out what it means?
We're the ones that failed to grow
Even though we've lived before
In this land that has replenished us
One day soon will come a storm
That will wash away all that's born
All the will remain will be forsaken

Is your reflection getting clearer
Is it what you like it to be?

Hey baby
There's a new thing going round
Made its way into your neighbourhood
Now it's right there in your own backyard
I guess you left it a little too late
When the myth has broken down
It's harder to keep the faith
I'm no Angel
You're no idea of a saint
I'm no hero
But with a little bit of love
I could've been real good for you
Like music, sweet music
Hear the words fall from your lips
We had it all and now we watch it fall
Moving light years from our fingertip
It wasn't only a four letter word
You twist it round and put it down
Cause it's easier than feeling hurt
I'm no Angel
You're no idea of a saint
I'm no hero
But with a little bit of love
I could've been real good for you
Well I'm not asking for forgiveness
No that's alright
Cause I know you're never gonna see the other side
The man upstairs
Knows how hard I tried
I'm no Angel
You're no idea of a saint
I'm no hero
But with a little bit of love
I could've been real good for you
I'm no Angel
You're no idea of a saint
I'm no hero

I worked so hard to get this far
A lifetime doing service
Can't stand a change or difference
It makes me feel so nervous
I've worn this wound for centuries
I look so good in my bandage
Of childhood games and fallacies
I save whatever i can manage
This is my life, this is my lot
It's not much, but it's all i've got
I won't let you take it away!
We're different shades
We're chalk and clay
We're fire and we're water
Don't talk to me of innocence
I lost it and forgot it
Ever since you came around
There's chaos in my order
I'm much too blind to ever see
We're all from the same father, father
I used to be good-looking
But my face became distorted
Something in my body hurts
I don't know how i got it
Looks like the devil's work to me
We were so simple and so clean
I won't let you take it from me!
We're different shades
We're chalk and clay
We're fire and we're water
Don't talk to me of innocence
I lost it and forgot it
Ever since you came around
There's chaos in my order
I'm much too blind to ever see
We're all from the same father, father...
They gave this gift to me, my
Mother's, mother's, mother's mother's family;
We love what we believe
You're lost if you can't see it!"

Maybe it's my blood sugar
Maybe it's because I'm mad
Maybe it's because things are going so good
That somehow I've got to make them go bad
Maybe it's because I like it
Maybe it's just that time
Well it sends shivers right through me
The way my own thoughts black and blue me
But I just can't get them out of my mind
It's the art of melancholy
I've really got it down
The art of melancholy
Sealed with a frown
Maybe I'm just self indulgent
Maybe I'm just insecure
Maybe it's my mother
Or some significant other
Maybe I'll never know for sure
I've got the art of melancholy
Down to a 'Tee'
The art of melancholy
I guess that's how I wanna be
I wanna be
One day I'll be smiling
Find my cloud has a silver lining
But for now I'll be blue
Aren't you
It's the art of melancholy
Down to a 'Tee'
The art of melancholy
I guess that's how I wanna be
I wanna be
That's how I wanna be"

Little secrets too bad to tell
Little secrets of my holy hell
I'm invaded without a sound
One word and it comes tumblin' down
This family is a tyranny
And it's ruled however he wants it to be
This family is a tyranny
And it's taken over me
I'm scared silent
I""m scared silent
In the name of love and violence
What i'm tryin' to forget, you'll never know.....
They come to me like photographs
I tear them up but they're still in my past
Little minefields, emotional debts
I try to run, but he's not through with me yet
This family is a tyranny
And it's ruled however he wants it to be
This family is a tyranny
And it's locked up inside of me

It's elaine's addiction
She thinks that i don't see
She suffers from delusions
Hides it all from me
She puts it in her bag
Puts it in her clothes
In her bedside table
In her wardrobe
If she didn't have a mouth
She'd probably put it in her nose;
She's in state 51
It doesn't look like fun
I hope she's gonna change
Before her body breaks-
But it's elaine's addiction
It's elaine's addiction
It's elaine's addiction
She says no one's to blame
She just likes being different
And borderline insane
She gets it from the car
>From the tv
>From the cornershop
And all her magazines
If she couldn't hurt herself
It could just as well be me;
She's in state 51

Is watching someone break-

Step inside the other gender
So fulfill the plan

Trade it for the other one

Smells of leather, school cafes
It hurt the first time i was laid
They gave me nine, but i want ten
And when i do come back again
Snake-hipped
Tight-lipped
James Dean on a saturday night
The wild one's
Depp's fun
The Marlon Brando we loved to like
I made my choice
No Hayward or Myrna Loy
I'm comin' back as a boy
It's not that i'm so discontented
I just want to be reinvented
We all need that change
A chance to feel the strange
Let every father be a mother
Every sister be a brother
A demigod or saboteur
Next time i'll be a him and not a her
They gave me nine, but this is ten
And when i do come back again
Snake-hipped
Tight-lipped

Just dreams could only hold us for so long

Just look up
We are both under the same starry sky
Surrounded by people
But you're the one that can get me high
Surrounded by people
But you're the one that won't pass me by
There is still much more to be done
In our hearts
And I'll find a way not to be misguided
We need no one to travel the world
Ain't much fast or slow
We'll find together the sky that will make us grow"

Verse
If only things were just the same
I'm hoping things will change
When I look back
I crawl back to you
You're like an angel
I can play that
I never thought that we could break up
Is that all you have got to say
I can play that, I can say that,
I can break that, I will take that
Chorus
I'll be holding on
even if I look insane
I've been finding it hard to say goodbye
When will you be gone
Because you ripping up my life
Now nothing is the same
I'm the one to blame
Verse
All-I-just-wanted
Confronted all the time by your irrational words
Of hate and love stop messing with my mind
Maybe I should just bite my tongue
Wiser words that I have sung
Lock my jaw and say no more
Your the one I cry out for (even if i wanted more was better.)
Chorus
I'll be holding on
even if I look insane
I've been finding it hard to say goodbye
When will you be gone
because you ripping up my life
Now nothing is the same
I'm the one to blame
Bridge
You cried in the morning
When I left I kept on stalling
And I have said somethings to hurt you
Because I, don't deserve you
Back when, this was a story
A messy end, A painful mend
And this was where I wanted it all to change"

1568,oxygen-and-me,2006,beckett,Rock,"Wake up,
Were leaving,
The sparks have hit the ceiling,
Our world has fallen to the ground.
Ill help you,
You need me,
Do my best to keep you breathing,
I can not make this on my own.
Its funny how you see it clearly,
As the light begins to, fade away.
We, weve been lost for so damn long,
Dont know how to sing along,
With society,
It was killing me,
Suffocating dreams.
Now you,
You need oxygen and me,
Its only now I see,
How lovely life has been,
How lucky we have been.
Hold on, dont leave me,
Im so scared, youre bleeding,
The walls are falling round us now.
Youre shaking, not making,
Sense of all this complication,
I will not leave you on your own."
1569,my-star,2006,beckett,Rock,"This is my situation
Im standing lonely at my local station
Its just me, Im being silly now
Its just me, feeling melancholy
You can make me smile
And you might just take these thoughts of frustration.
I know were all the same
We lose all faith every now and then
And theres gonna be those bright days
But till then, Ill be standing in the rain.
So I wait in anticipation
I hope I live to fill all your expectations, but you say
Live for today, not tomorrow
Live for today, forget yesterday
And love this life, with all its strife
And dance like no one can see you.
I know were all the same
We lose all faith every now and then
And theres gonna be those bright days
But till then, Ill be standing in the rain, standing in the rain."
1570,anything,2006,beckett,Rock,"Ill follow the wind,
Let it take me home,
I have become someone,
I do not know,
Ive fallen in love,
With everyone I see,
What must these strangers,
Think of me.
So I look to the east,
Then I deal with the west,
Im not gonna loose to this test.
You can do anything you want,
You can do anything you want,
The road is long, the road is full of nails,
But you can, you can do anything you want.
I make no apologies,
If you dont like what you see,
Im sick of dancing,
To your melody,
Its a long, long show,
But well make it through,
Whats the point in dreams,
If dreams dont come true,
So I look to the left,
Then I deal with the right,
Im not gonna loose,
To this fight.
You can do anything you want,
You can do anything you want,
The road is long, the road is full of nails,
But you can, you can do anything you want,
Anything at all,
Anything your heart has been searching for.
You can do anything you want,
So make your life how you want it now,
Do not listen to,
The ones that bring you down,
Youre the only one,
But youre not alone,
And your kingdom can be,
Your own home,
You can be anything you want."
1571,waiting-for-you,2006,beckett,Rock,"They've run me out of town
Put me in their lost and found.
Because I cant find myself
And dont wanna be anyone else.
I guess I feel it more than most
And Im still dancing with your ghost
Yeah, Im still waiting for you.
Hey, tell me how you are
I never got that far inside your head
You could teach me how to win
And please teach me not to sin, oh yeah.
I guess I feel it more than most
And Im still dancing with your ghost
Yeah, Im still waiting for you
Yeah, Im still waiting for you.
In my dream
I felt your body
And I knew you were close to me
In my dream, I always dream
Wed run away just you and me.

Yeah, Im still waiting for you

Do all that you can to,
Hold onto the steering wheel,
Ive seen it, I know that,
The crash it is coming soon,
You can borrow the sun,
But please dont steal the moon.
They say the good will come out,
Light the sky up,
Those angels are coming down,
To set us free,
Love will save us,
But cupids dangerous,
Those angels are coming down,
To set us free.
The secrets they lay underground,
The mad man he listens for hours,
But without a sound,
I know that hes sane,
Its just something you can not assume,
You can borrow her body,
But please dont steal her soul."
1573,bruised-feet,2006,beckett,Rock,"It's been a long, long hard day
I thought there is nothing you could say, to take my blues away
Yeah I've been running for too long
And all my feet are bruised
All I can seem to do is lose, lose, lose, lose, lose
And then you come along and you know just what to say
Yeah you come along and you brighten up my day, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah you, yeah you, I'll do anything that you want me too for you
Yeah I'll bruise my feet for you, yeah I'll bruise my feet for you
Yeah I was wondering why I try with all these dreams when they all seem so far away
But there's nothing i can do, I'm a hopeless dreamer it's true and my faith in me was through
Until you came along and you knew just what to say
Yeah you came along and you brightened up my day, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah you, yeah you, I'll do anything that you want me too for you
Yeah I'll bruise my feet for you, yeah I'll bruise my feet for you
Yeah you, yeah you, I'll do anything that you want me too for you
Yeah I'll bruise my feet for you, yeah I'll bruise my feet for you"
1574,karma-s-coming-down,2006,beckett,Rock,"Growing and learning and letting go
Everyday Im getting better you know
Its something we dont like to talk about
Its something you know we need to let out
So come on, can you feel it in this song?
Look at me what am I looking for
Everything I want is on this floor
It doesnt really matter what you think of me
It doesnt really matter about everything I used to be
Because its falling all around us now
And when they see us they say we cannot waste, cannot waste our time
This may be the song that makes you change
I can't stop the rain that falls and you take it all
And you lose it to the thing you want
The most I know this love will grow and grow
Because its falling all around us now
And when they see us they say we cannot waste, cannot waste our time
Karmas coming down
Karmas coming down
Karmas coming down, all around this town
Karmas coming down
Karmas coming down
Because its falling all around us now
And when they see us they say we cannot waste, cannot waste our time

I said I was yours, but you know I was mine
You know I was mine, I was mine all the time."

I said that wed be friends until the end
But everythings turned around.
Weve been left with different plans
And Im suppressing all my fears
I dont want any other tears, oh no.
Ill go driving in my car
And Ill drive and drive so far
And I cannot feel my body
It looks as though Im gonna hurt somebody.
Then you come around
You say Ive made a mess of it all
And youre making me feel so small
My lifes this lucid dream
And Im living it on my own
For a minute I thought I was home
And you cared.
Ill go driving in my car
And Ill drive and drive so far
And I cannot feel my body
It looks as though Im gonna hurt somebody.
I dont wanna hurt nobody
Live life in the country
Im looking for salvation
In the hope, that it will spread right across this god damn shallow nation
Oh yeah.

Girl, tell me how you like it,
Ima do it right baby
Won't stop even if it takes all night
I've wanted this far too long
So right that it can't be wrong

Whenever the night comes
We gon' do it again
I don't want it to end
I wanna be more than just friends
I never thought I'd see the day
Where I could call you my lady

Come on, I feel alive with you baby
Come on, I wanna ride with you baby
And make that summer love
Come on, let's put the top down
Come on, I wanna rock now baby
Come on, let's put the top down baby
And make that summer love
Come on, won't you be my lady
Come on, you know you drive me crazy
Come on, won't you be mine
And make that summer love
Come on, let em watch us baby
Let em say something, let em say something
Come on, let em watch us baby
And make that summer love

Here we are caught up in the same routine//
We're at it again back and forth sayin things we know we don't mean//
I wanna believe you when you tell me that you're gonna change this time//
Tell me do you really see a fool when you're lookin into my eyes//
...and you tell me what I wanna hear//
You tell me what you know I'll believe//
To temporarily mend the broken pieces of you and I//
That won't last...but maybe that's just me
CHORUS:
Somebody tell me what it is that keeps me coming back to you//
I don't know what it is//
... but love always wins//
VERSE II:
I put up with your love for the last 3 years and I'm givin' it back//
I don't know what it is bout this time but I don't feel bad//
Cuz I gave you my all. My heart. My soul. My everything. //
I was ready to give you my last name and do anything//
how do you give a love so deep to someone w/ a heart so shallow?//
but at the end of the day, I find myself back with you so I guess I just don't know//
CHORUS:
Somebody tell me what it is that keeps me coming back to you//
I don't know what it is//
... but love always wins//
Somebody tell me how to get things back the way they used to be//
but that's not how it is//
Cuz love always wins//
BRIDGE:
Let's get back to the days where I could see the light in your eyes while we're layin in the dark//
Even though it's not the same as before, I can still see the old you in your heart//
CHORUS:
Somebody tell me what it is that keeps me coming back to you//
I don't know what it is//
... but love always wins//
Somebody tell me how to get things back the way they used to be//
but that's not how it is//
Cuz love always wins//
Somebody tell me what it is that keeps me coming back to you//
I don't know what it is//

Somebody tell me how to get things back the way they used to be//

Who left such a cheeky shrine

In it stood a wooden horse so tall the water reached but half its leg
A sign nearby read ""Damn You Law--this horse's hollow core
Contains the means for your destruction!""
This all passersby ignored
""Save us, save us...""
When the great explorers, fortune hunters / Slave men, conmen set their sails
They dreamed of monsters without brains
Great hulks to block their treasure trail
Well, they got by with homicide but here's the end to the magic spell:
Now the monsters lie in mouths, in veins, in genitals, in empty bellies
Baby, baby, won't you treat me kind?
I'm only a white man who longs to die
To end I need the power that you must give me
Send the children outside! Don't resist! Don't cry!""
The ray of hope as hoe of rape
Reflecting light from tractor headlamps into the victim's face
We bleat about our pain and how we lost and feel defiled
And we cry all night for Santa Claus to make our blizzard mild
The poor kind European white man never hurt a fly
We were friends to all the races, every woman, every child
""Save us, save us...""
So back in the dirty hotel I lay in my clothes and I slept
I dreamed that I was face-to-face with an amorous dragon
Who wanted to kill me and beckoned
I approached, unsheathed, and said, ""Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!""
Let me be at one with my destruction

Underneath the white light

Sees the growth as just so much cabbage (""Take the bone saw--"")
That must now be cut away (""--and cut around the perimeter."")

Doctor is making the first incision
One goes here and one goes there
""Ether tubes are leaking"", says someone who's sloppy

High up above the crowd
the great Valerio is walking
The rope seems hung from cloud to cloud
and time stands still as he is walking
His eye is steady on the target
His foot is sure upon the rope
Alone and peaceful as a mountain
and certain as a mountain slope
We falter at the sight
We stumble in the mire
Fools who think they see the light
Prepare to balance on the wire
But we learn to watch together
and feed on what we see above
until our hearts turn like the seasons
and we are acrobats of love

How we wonder, how we wonder, watching down below
We would all be that great hero

Lift the roof with his bare hands
and hand you down his just demands
as you huddle in your tiny corner
The door-to-door inspector now sits to eat his lunch
He scowls at last week's paper
in the worker's cafe, hushed
You made your choice whan mocking the ways of true grown men

They only ever saw him smiling
He breathes the air of the barber's shop
The steam, smoke and cheap cologne
He says, ""Old man, tell this razor blade
how much you want to be left alone.""
Over the mirror to the left
A postcard girl with naked breasts
brings us greetings from Crete to this ugly man's street just by smiling
Look, she's all smiling
Yeah, she pouts and acts hot with James Bond on his yacht
His arching eyebrow, his martini seed
while in her village in Milan starving people stole cans
and [bad] silver or the loser will bleed
In a few more years the cruel boy makes his way
up to where the real power is
until a bomb in his car blows him all over a wall

With your faithless wit and your aimless guile
And your [fall from] hands and your shame faced smile

Though I have done great wrongs of my own.""
They were long ago
So how could you know?
I never asked for your pity
That's just as well if you ask me

And a rumble built to become a roar
But she screamed, ""it's you!
Every day you wake is gonna end in hate!""

How could I tell her the truth?
I climbed up out of her hall
And went to sleep on the roof
When I woke up to the sun
Her brother brought me some food
And we played cards until 'noon
Five stories up from [...?]
The pools of blood and the blasted rocks
And the children screaming who will never stop
And the blast of heat
And the stench of gas
And the lost dogs fighting over human scraps
And she called to us from the street beneath
""My footloose ways will be the death of me!""
And she took the hand of a drunk militia captain
Not a stone will stand upon a stone
Not a stone will stand upon a stone

Her body patched but past repair, and there her angel stood
She was feeling quite confused now that her death was close at hand
She had to face eternity, so why not this mumbling man?
Who bought himself a wedding suit at a local warrant sale
It belonged to some old Turkish man who'd owed and gone to jail
He would coax her mind with talk of love to make her body kind
Because people hate the truth, you know; they need their pack of lies
Growing tired of being foreign, being spat on and shortchanged
He demanded that she leave with him for the land from whence he came
They were herded on like cattle to a ferry at high tide
This unkempt, aging orphan and his helpless, dying bride
But he left her at the other shore crying on the deck
She was slumped against the rail as he had struck to free his neck
and the customs shed was empty as he made his way inside
There were no chimpanzees in uniform to hear his pack of lies
Now she's ascending into heaven with contentment on her face
and Holy God is there to greet and batter her into her place
But meanwhile back on Earth, we see the prodigal's returned
and they're making him the chieftain and they've come to him to learn
How the neighbours in he rich land better steal and kill and lie
and when they ask who calls the weaklings there he just shrugs and says, ""Not I!""
Though surrounded by diseases, I stood tall and kept my health
I could have been important if I'd been somebody else
The moral of this story is: This land's a victim-farm
Don't you ever feed a beggar here, he'll eat your fucking arm
and don't blaspheme the strong ones if you want to stay alive

1674,bertie-s-brochures,2007,fatima-mansions,Rock,"August the 20th: Yes, folks, it's another cold, clammy day in England. A large crowd has gathered around the police station. Everybody--EVERYBODY--wishes to have contact with a certain little Irish writer within. Not to discuss his works, though the works are known to them; they've been published in the tabloid papers by the police under the heading ""Barbaric Butcher's Brochures"". No, they want to tear his very head from his body, for what it is alleged he did in the way of mortal damage to two soldiers in a nearby public lavatory. The night draws in. Nobody would say a word about him, except a fool like me [(and his skin)].
In rainy Ireland in the 50's
There outside a pink farmhouse door
A small Bertie, playing at digging trenches,
asks, ""Daddy, what's the blowtorch for?""
He said, ""The torch will cut the cars to turn them into sculpture
so I can express what I feel. The college men may laugh,
the farmers persecute me, but I do for myself. So should you.""
Come look at Bertie's brochures
You'll be enchanted, I am sure
The whole world's in Bertie's brochures:
All the wisdom, the smiles of dear friends
Through freakshow Britain, through the Eighties
Bertie works in labs, though his father's aims still endure
though only at night does he do his real work
Learning, writing his brochures...
for he still believes that everyone's a poet
and that all he has to do is to set it down
and so transform the milkman,
the waitress and the gunman into immortal ART!!
Now they're laughing at Bertie's brochures
Detectives with crowbars and skewers
They see things in Bertie's brochures:
Their own hatred of all other races and their fear
Don't laugh at Bertie's brochures
He would not if they were yours
So what if your enemy is there?
Bertie's an artist, so why should he care?
It's the north European peasant experience"

On their dim walk to work with their eyes slit so small
For the dawn and the path and their shekels of mine

Now I live by the railway with the rest of the coven
In a hovel vibrating lit by tandoori ovens

We get raided on Fridays, we get drunk when they leave us
We discuss ways to die, ways we could have gone wrong
We don't mention the now
We can see no way out
We draw skulls on the walls
We draw blood from our balls
We play catch with the rats
(Still) the silence won't crack though we heave and we hack

Look what I stole! Look what I stole for us, darling!
Maybe we're dead, I forgot
They're hunting us, so maybe not
Oh, let us mention her torso: heat, electrical chaos
If it burst she would die, oh, oh, oh
Wasn't it kind of her to let me in?
Will it get fat when it's older
Get all riddled with cancer
While she stays the same person who is fucking me now?
See the view from above of the sofa of love
With the roof cut away, cars and people out there
And the stains spreading out and out, blood running cold
Look what I stole! Look what I stole for us, darling!
Look what I stole! Look what I stole for us, darling!

I listened to your kisses at the door
I never heard a world so clear before
You ran your bath and you began to sing
I felt so good I couldn't feel a thing--CHORUS

Too many hatreds for making amends.
Too many favours for friends of dead friends.

Got a trampoline--your fuckin' head

I've got no secrets, cash or time left to give you
But I've got something else for you, my friend

And all that's left is broken glass?

The stitches torn and broke

You have no past, you have no guilt
You've arrived, you've arrived

You've arrived, you've arrived on Valhalla Avenue
You were a drunk, you kept a filthy home
and you hated hard with confusion in your heart
The barren weeks, the amnesiac years
You'd put the world off till tomorrow and let despair tear you apart
Well, now they're breaking down the door
Your hideaway is safe no more
Scream as they drag you from your bed
When you recount from a bleeding head

And bring your waitress from the other side of a world

From my bed to the street it is 30 paces (and getting nearer)
And I sniff and repent in all the right places
And a speeding truck crashes into the front door
And the telephone rings and says, ""Have you no conscience?""
When planning a genocide, starting a war
Say that it's gentler than others before
It sells lots of TV's and ribbons and flags
And makes all the doubters look spineless and bad
Even big heads of state should spray in their wake
The perfumes of paradise"

And wild seas lie still, deep and blue
Though life has sent me troubles, I'll feel no pain
If I never spend a morning without you
If I never spend a morning without you
When hope was an ocean-pounding heart
Then love was the ship that carried me through
And now I've reached my Island I'll find peace again
If I never spend a morning without you
If I never spend a morning without you
Old the land, older its people. But the promise of new life is still
the victor o'er decay. Hold the dream, pass by the stranger,
He can never call this land his home
Nor wish the truth away.
With the honesty of fire light on your face
We while away the hours as lovers do
At the closing of the evening I will ask no more
If I never spend a morning without you
If I never spend a morning without you
Old the land, older its people. But the promise of new life is still
the victor o'er decay. Hold the dream, pass by the stranger,
He can never call this land his home
Nor wish the truth away.
Though tomorrow is still no more than dreams
It's yesterday that gives me strength to do
For the hardest roads will run like silk to me,
it seems.

If I never spend a morning without you"

1712,tak-it-man-tak-it,2007,andy-m-stewart,Folk,"When I was a miller in Fife,
Losh! I thought that the sound o' the happer
Said, ``Tak' hame a wee flow to your wife,
To help to mak' brose to your supper.''
Then my conscience was narrow and pure,
But someway by random it rackit;
For I lifted twa neivefu' or mair,
While the happer said, ``Tak' it, man tak' it.''
Then hey for the mill and the kiln,
The garland and gear for my cogie,
And hey for the whisky and gill,
That washes the dust frae my craigie.
Although it's been lang in repute
For rogues to mak' rich by deceiving,
Yet I see that it disna weel suit
Honest men to begin to the thieving.
For my heart it gaed dunt upon dunt,
Oh, I thought ilka dunt it wad crack it;
Sae I flang frae my neive what was in't,
Still the happer said, ``Tak' it, man, tak' it.''
A man that's been bred to the plough,
Might be deav'd wi' its clamorous clapper;
Yet there's few but would suffer the sough,
After kenning what's said by the happer.
I whiles thought it scoff'd me to scorn,
Saying, ``Shame, is your conscience no chackit?''
But when I grew dry from a horn,
It chang'd aye to ``Tak' it, man, tak' it.''
The smugglers whiles cam' wi' their pocks,
'Cause they kent that I likit a bicker,
Sae I bartered whiles wi' the gowks,
Gied them grain for a sowp o' their liquor.
I had lang been accustomed to drink,
And aye when I purposed to quat it,
That thing wi' its clappertie clink
Said aye to me, ``Tak' it, man, tak' it.''
But the warst thing I did in my life,
Nae doot but ye'll think I was wrang o't;
Od! I tauld a bit bodie in Fife
A' my tale, and he made a bit sang o't.
I have aye had a voice a' my days,
But for singin' I ne'er gat the knack o't;
Yet I try whyles, just thinking to please
The greedy, wi' ``Tak' it, man, tak' it.''
Now, miller and a' as I am,
This far I can see through the matter;
There's men mair notorious to fame,
Mair greedy than me o' the muter.
For 'twad seem that the hale race o' men,
Or, wi' safety, the hauf we may mak' it,
Ha'e some speaking happer within,
That said to them ``Tak' it, man, tak' it.''"

And if you'd return then I'd make you my bride
Or I'd cross the wild Atlantic to be by your side
On the morning we parted, how sad the farewell
Our words, they were few, but our thoughts none could tell
And when lost to my vision far over the brine
I drank your success in a goblet of wine
Three times have I crossed to the ship as she lay
Becalmed on the breast of the silvery bay
And my crew are the bravest ever handled an oar
And not by the tempest, they laugh at its roar
No ballroom can tempt me nor raise my dispair
For there none in the dance that with you can compare
And to watch the young lovers as they swing 'round the floor
Brings tears to these eyes that may see you no more
And in beauty there's none with this lady could buy
She's as pure as the stars and the blue of the sky
She's as fair as a lily and as sweet as a rose
And there's nothing can tempt me, her name to disclose
No drink will I take for to lighten my heart
But the wildest adventures I'll take for my part
No women on earth will I have for a bride
'Til I cross the wild Atlantic to be your side
Ah me, I must mourn my true love evermore

Their dogs of war were loosed to run
And hunt the rebels down
They hoped to rule this land by fear
And hold it for the Crown
But a mighty thought was born in Men
When they killed James Connolly
Oh that night they wounded Old Ireland
And she's bleeding to this day.
The Border lies like an open wound
That only love can heal
For bitterness and cruelty
They will never close the weal
The mean of vision built a dream
Which the blind men stole away
Ah that night they wounded old Ireland
And she's bleeding to this day.

That thousands more can see
Of Ireland free from hatred
And death and bigotry
Where Irishman to Irishman
Can in friends clasp a hand
If we banish fright from the Ulster night
Then we'll free Old Ireland."

1731,dinny-the-piper-amhran-na-tae-song-of-the-tea,2007,andy-m-stewart,Folk,"In the year '98, when our troubles were great
It was treason to be a Milesian.
And the black-whiskers said we would never forget
And our history shows they were Hessians.
And in these troubled times, it was a great crime
And martyrdom never was riper
Near the town of Glenshee, not an acre from Meath,
Lived one Denny Burns, the Piper!
Neither weddin' nor wake would be worth a shake
If Denny was first not invited.
For at squeezin' the bag, or emptyin' the keg,
He astonished as well as delighted!
But in these times Denny could not earn a penny,
Martial Law had him stung like a viper!
And it kept him within till the bones of his skin
Grinned thru the rags of the piper!
Now one day it did dawn, as Denny crept home,
Back from a fair at Lethangin,
When what should he see, from the branch of a tree,
But the corpse of a Hessian, there hangin'!
Says Denny, ""These rogues have got boots, I've no brogues!""
He took hold of the boots wi' a griper,
And the boots were so tight, and he pulled with such might,
Legs and all come away with the piper!
Ah, then Denny did run for fear of bein' hung
Til he came to Tim Haley's cabin.
Says Tim from within, ""I can't let ye in!
Ye'll be shot if you're caught out there rappin'!""
So he went to the shed where the cow was in bed,
He began with a whisp for to wipe her,
And they lay down together, in seven foot of heather,
And the cow took to huggin' the piper!
Well the day it wore on, and Denny did yawn,
And he stripped off the boots from the Hessian!
And the legs, be the law, he just left in the straw,
And he slipped home with his new possessions!
Now breakfast bein' done, Tim sent his young son
To get Denny up like a lamplighter,
And the legs there he saw; he flew up like a jackdaw!
And said ""Daddy, the cow's et the piper!""
Ah, bad luck to that beast, she's no musical taste!
To eat such a jolly old chanter!
A Phairaig a mhic, Take a lump of a stick!
Drive her off, down the road and we'll canter!
Well the neighbors were called, Mrs. Kennedy bawled,
She began for to humbug and jiper,
And in sorrow they met, and their whistles they wet,
And like devils, lamented the piper!
(more!)
Denny The Piper (Cont.)
And the cow she was drove a mile or two off,
And they came to a fair at Killaley.
And there she was sold for four guineas of gold
To the clerk of the parish, John Daly.
And they went to the tent where the pennies were spent,
Tim bein' a jolly old swiper,
And who should be there, playin' the Rakes of Killdare,
Just your bold Denny Burns, the piper!
Ah, then Tim give a jolt like a half-drunken colt,
And he stares at the piper like a gamog,
I thought, by the Powers, for the last sev'ral hours,
You were playin' in the old cow's stomach!
Well when Denny observed that the Hessian's been served
Began just to humbug and jiper,
Oh, in grandeur they met, and their whistles they wet,
And like devils they danced round the piper!"

That wanders so far from his home,
That sighs for protection from want, woe, and danger,
That knows not from which way for to roam.
Yet I'll never return to Hibernia's green bowers,
For tyranny tramples the sweetest of flowers,
That once gave me comfort in loneliest hours
Now they are gone I shall ne'er see them more.
With wonder I gazed on yon lofty building,
As in grandeur I rose from its lord,
But soon I beheld my fair garden yielding
The choicest of fruit for his foe.
But, where is my father's lone cottage of clay,
Wherein I' ve spent many a long day,
Alas ! has his lordship conniv'd it away ?
Yes, it is gone, I shall never see it more.
When nature was seen in the sloe bush and bramble,
All smiling in beautiful bloom,
Over the fields without danger, I often
Did ramble amidst their perfume ;
I have wranged through the woods where the gay feather'd
throng
Joyfully sung their loud echoing song
These days then of summer passed sweetly along,
Now they're goneI shall ne'er see them more !
When the sloe and the berries hung ripe on the bushes
I have gathered them off without harm
I have gone to the field and shorn the green rushes,
Preparing for winter's cold storm !
Along with my friends telling tales of delight,
Beguiling the hours of the long winter's night,
Those days gave me pleasureI could them invite ;
Now they're gone, I shall ne'er see them more."

1737,the-banks-of-sweet-dundee,2007,andy-m-stewart,Folk,"There was a fair young lady so lately I've been told
She lived with her uncle, the cause of all her woes;
Her uncle had a ploughboy, which Mollie liked quite well
And in her uncle's garden their tender love did tell.
So early one morning this old man he arose
And at Mollie's room door he hastened on his clothes,
Saying, "" Arise you handsome female, and married you shall be
For the squire is a-waiting on the banks of sweet Dundee.
""A fig to all your squires, to lord and Jews likewise,
For William 'pears like diamonds a-glittering in my eyes.""
""You never shall have Willie, nor happy shall you be
For I mean to banish Willie from the banks of sweet Dundee.""
The first crowd came on Willie when he was all alone,
He fought full hard for his liberty, but there were eight to one;
""Pray kill me now,"" says Willie, ""Pray kill me now,"" says he
""For I'd rather die for Mollie on the banks of sweet Dundee.""
As Mollie was walking, lamenting for her love
She meets the wealthy squire, all in her uncle's grove.
""Stand off, stand off!"" says Mollie, ""Stand off, you man,"" says she,
""For I'd rather die for Willie on the banks of sweet Dundee.""
He threw his arms around her and crushed her to the ground,
There she spied two pistols and a sword beneath his morning-gown;
The pistols she slipped slyly, and the sword she used free
She shot and killed the squire on the banks of sweet Dundee.
Her uncle overheard them, come hastening to the grove
Saying, ""You've killed the wealthy squire, prepare for your death-blow,""
""Stand off, stand off!"" says Mollie, ""Stand off, you man, says she,""
So the trigger drew and her uncle slew on the banks of sweet Dundee.
The doctor being sent for, he knew that they were killed
Also there came a lawyer to write the old man's will.
He willed his gold to Mollie, because she fought so free
Then closed his eyes to write no more on the banks of sweet Dundee"

The dew on his thin robe was heavy and chill;
For his country he sighed, when at twilight reparing.
To wander alone by the wind-beaten hill.
But the day-star attracted his eyes' sad devotion,
For it rose o'er his own native isle of the ocean,
When once in the fire of his youthful emotion,
He sang the loud anthem of Erin-go-Bragh.
""Sad is my fate!"" said the heart-broken stranger :
The wild-deer and wolf to a convert can flee.
But I have no refuge from famine and danger-
A home and a country remain not to me.
Never again, in the green sunny bowers,
Where my forefathers lived, shall I spend the sweet hours,
Or cover my harp with the wild-women flower,
And strike to the numbers of Erin-go-Bragh.
""Erin, my country ! though sad and forsaken,
In dreams I revisit thy sea beaten shore:
But alas ! in a far foreign land I awaken,
And sigh for the friends who can meet me no more
O! cruel fate ! wilt thou never replace me
In a mansion of peace where no perils can chase me?
Never again shall my brothers embrace me.
They died to defend me, or live to deplore.
""Where is my cabin door, fast by the wild wood?
Sisters and sire, did you weep for its fall?
Where is the mother that looked on my childhood?
And where is the bosom friend dearer than all?
O! my sad heart! long abandoned by pleasure,
Why did it dote on fast-fading treasure?
Tears, like the rain-drops, may fall with-out measure,
But rapture and beauty they cannot recall."

And his lip would reach the pavement.
He's been hiding from his razor,
Is he not an awful sight?
In love he was the purist,
How he's frightening our tourists.
If he'd gone and asked his father
Oh, I'm sure he'd set him right, sayin'
""Take her in your arms
And tell her that you love her,
Take her in your arms
And hold that woman tight.
Won't you take her in your arms
And tell her that you love her.
If you're going to love a woman
Then be sure you do it right.""
Now he met her at a disco
In a dive in San Francisco
And it all might have been different
Had he seen her in daylight.
She was painted, she was scented,
But she drove your man demented
If he'd gone and asked his father
Oh, I'm sure he'd set him right, sayin'
Here's a pub with fun and laughter
The landlord's buying bevvy.
There's a session in the corner
And the crack is grand tonight,
But your man who's lost his woman,
He's still at home lamenting.
If he'd gone and asked his father
Oh, I'm sure he'd set him right, sayin'
Now, depression's not a million laughs
But suicide's too dangerous.
Don't go leppin' out of buildings
In the middle of the night.
It's not the fall --- but landin'
That'll alter social standin'
So go first and ask your father
Oh, I'm sure he'll set you right, sayin'
Here's a health to all true lovers,
Their sisters and their brothers,
And their uncles and their grannies,
For this thing is black and white.

With its leppin' and its dancin'

They swore theyd send him from the island.

In spite of me he will transport you.
So arise, my love, and go away,

Oh must I go without my wages.
Without one penny allin my purse
Just like some poor, forlorn stranger
Heres fifty guineas all in bright gold
And thats far more than father owes you.
So take it now and go away,
I wish to God Id gone before you.

And round his neck her arms entwined.

1759,patrick-sheehan,2007,andy-m-stewart,Folk,"My name is Patrick Sheehan, and my years are thirty-four;
Tipperary is my native place, not far from Galtymore;
I came of honest parents, but now they're lying low;
Though' many's the pleasant days we spent in the Glen of Aherlow.
My father died; I closed his eyes, outside the cabin door;
For the landlord and the sheriff too, were there the day before,
And then my lovin' mother, and my sisters three, also,
Were forced to go with broken hearts, from the Glen of Aherlow
For three long months, in search of work, I wandered far and near;
I then went to the poorhouse to see my mother dear;
The news I heard near broke my heart, but still in all my woe,
I blessed the friends who made their graves in the Glen of Aherlow.
Bereft of home and kith and kin, with plenty all around,
I starved within my cabin, and slept upon the ground;
But cruel as my lot was, I never did hardship know,
Till I joined the English army, far away from Aherlow.
""Rouse up there,"" cried the corporal, ""Ya lazy Irish hound!
Why don't you hear the bugle, its call to arms to sound? ""
I found I had been dreaming of the days long, long ago,
And I woke upon Sebastopol, and not in Aherlow
I tried to find my musket, how dark I thought the night!
O blessed God! It wasn't dark, it was the broad daylight!
And when I found that I was blind, my tears began to flow,
And I longed for even a pauper's grave in the Glen of Aherlow.
A poor neglected mendicant, I wander Dublin's streets
My nine months' pension it being out, I beg from all I meet;
As I joined my country's tyrants, my face I can never show,
Amongst my dear old neighbors in the Glen of Aherlow.
So Irish youths, dear countrymen, take heed in what I say;
For if you join the English ranks, you'll surely rue the day
And whenever you're tempted, a-soldiering to go.
Remember poor blind Sheehan from the Glen of Aherlow."
1760,the-humours-of-whiskey,2007,andy-m-stewart,Folk,"Let your quacks and newspapers be cutting their capers
About curing the vapors the scratch and the gout
With their medical potions, their serums and their lotions
Upholding their notions, they're mighty put out.
Who can tell the true physic to all that's pathetic
And pitch to the divil, cramp, colic and spleen
You'll know it I think if you take a big drink
With your mouth to the brink of a jug of poteen
So stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature
For sinking your sorrows and raising your joys
Oh what botheration, no dose in the nation
Can give consolation like poteen me boys.
No liquid cosmetic to lovers athletic
Or bodies pathetic can give such a bloom
As the sweet by the powers in the garden of flowers
Ever gave their own bowers such a darling perfume
And this liquid so rare if you willingly share
To be taking your hair when it's frizzled and dead
Oh the sod has the merit to yield the true spirit
So strong it will shake all the hairs from your head
Then stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature
For sinking your sorrows and raising your joys
Oh since its perfection, no doctor's direction
Can cleanse the complexion like poteen me boys
While a child in me cradle, me nurse with her ladle
Was filling my mouth with a notion of pap
When a drop from her bottle fell into my throttle
I stumbled and capered clean out of her lap
On the floor I lay crawlin' and screaming and bawling
'Til me mother and father were called to the fore
All sobbing and sighing they feared I was dying
But soon found I only was crying for more.
So stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature
For sinking your sorrows and raising your joys
Oh lord how they'd chuckle if babes in their truckle
They only could suckle on poteen me boys
Through my youthful aggression, through times of depression
My childhood's impression still clung to my mind
And at school or at college the basis of knowledge
I never could gulp 'til with whiskey combined
And as older I'm growing times ever bestowin'
On Erin's potation, a flavor so fine
And how ere they may lecture on jove and his nectar
Itself is the only true liquid divine
So stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature
For sinking your sorrows and raising your joys
Oh lord, 'tis the right thing for courting and fighting
There's nowt so exciting as poteen me boys.
Come guess me this riddle, what beats pipes and fiddle
What's hotter than mustard and milder than cream
What best wets your whistle, what's clearer than crystal
What's sweeter than honey and stronger than steam
What'll make the lame walk, what will make the dumb talk,
The elixir of life and philospher's stone
And what helped Mr. Brunnell to build the Thames Tunnel
Wasn't it poteen from ould Inisowen
So stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature
For sinking your sorrows and raising your joys
Oh lord, it's no wonder, if lightning and thunder
Weren't made from the plunder of poteen me boys.
You maidens pathetic, with lovers athletic
For liquid cosmetic, you can't beat the drop
With a glow to your cheek, it will make your heart leap
It'll quiet a stallion or cure an old cob
At the mouth you would drool, be reduced to a fool
You'd kick up your heels and you'd peel to the buff
Then 'tis he'd be pathetic while you'd be athletic
If only you'd take a few drops of the stuff
So stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature
For sinking your sorrows and raising your joys
For there's nothing like whiskey to make maidens frisky
It soon separates all the men from the boys."

I feel so extraordinary
Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A sudden sense of liberty
I don't care 'cause I'm not there
And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow
Again and again I've taken too much
Of the things that cost you too much
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun...
When I was a very small boy,
Very small boys talked to me
Now that we've grown up together
They're afraid of what they see
That's the price that we all pay
And the value of destiny comes to nothing
I can't tell you where we're going
I guess there was just no way of knowing
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun...
I feel so extraordinary
Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A sudden sense of liberty
The chances are we've gone too far
You took my time and you took my money
Now I fear you've left me standing
In a world that's so demanding
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun..."
1839,the-racking-call,2007,dreadful-shadows,Rock,"When all the clouds surround my head
Like bandages of ice
As if they could heal my wounds, but they're incurable
When all the branches stroke my hair
Like your fingers do
As if they could make me forget, but I can't walk back
I hear another racking call, it burns me out
When all the fog rises up
Like a white veil of silk
As if it could close my eyes, but I've seen too much
And again I hear this racking call, it burns me out
I see you walking barefoot, I feel your dying shades
I know your world will crumble down
I hear your evil laughing, I watched your killing change
And I hear another racking call
So I am stumbling through the night
Confused and destroyed
Can noone hear my cries for help?
But maybe I am dumb
I feel my body escaping, somehow my body is failing
I scream - another racking call"
1840,condemnation,2007,dreadful-shadows,Rock,"The last glance at your door is killing me slow
Like a final sign of time
And these handcuffs can't tie me to this world
No answers can be given anymore
And so the winter came when we waited for the sun
It's the icy breath of a flower
In isolation I cry, but no tears leaves my eye
And the walls will crush me again
A child screams - innocent and silent in this night
Far away...
Glass is breaking with a noise
Louder than I ever heard before
Let me out
All that we wanted was eternity
Didn't care for the price we would pay
But now you're alone, I don't know where
And I ask you how long must I stay
Let me out!"

1842,everlasting-words,2007,dreadful-shadows,Rock,"I don't believe in the phrases of a dying age
These never ending thoughts will drag me to death
I always see the empire of the falling rain
And I answer with a smile
Should I pray? Should I die? I'll die!
I'm following the way to beyond
Following the pain to the endless haze
And the fire and poison around goes through me
My hands touched the borders of my life
The tearful try to breathe, the endless fight to be
And nothing will drown me again and rape me
Give me a place to begin to recover
Give me the time to begin my work
I don't want no more of the air that I'm breathing
I understand your everlasting words
Those many ways converge in this point
The answers of all thoughts are raining down on me
Cold tears pouring down my face, they kill me
And my questions and my feelings
and my senses are unimportant now
And your voice that still remains in my ears
I don't care, I don't want it anymore!"
1843,estrangement,2007,dreadful-shadows,Rock,"The birds in the sky are the last,
Seeing the sun goes down
Before the world sinks in black light
As it's burnt it soars in the universe
Left of feelings and warmth
Only a cold wind stays
A wind devastating everything
A short view - and we fall in the eternity
Free of sorrows and fear
Free of pleasure and luck
Free and thrust out
Praying for another life"
1844,chains,2007,dreadful-shadows,Rock,"Captured by time, I'm trying to move
But my limbs don't react. I've lost control
I'm so frail but I'm reaching the door
And I lean against, but it's closed
The fire will burn, no matter what I'm trying to do
And it seems that the flames are laughing
Figures all around, they're reaching for me
The play with me, a bloody game
And I'm tired now, I don't care anymore
'cause there is nothing I can do, nothing I could ever do
And my chains won't fall
My legs are burning and still there's no way out
No chance to escape
A last unbearable pain
And for a second I heard a voice
But I don't care anymore, I care for nothing anymore
I am insensitive now
My chains won't fall
I'll always be locked in this iron cage, where no key exist
I feel that something cuts my veins but they're dried up
I've lost all my sanity, I'm paralysed
But I don't care anymore, I care for nothing anymore
My chains won't fall"

Another time I've lost my balance
When my eyes turned gray
Too many screams don't let me fall asleep
Too many dreams that I have buried deep inside
Calling the sun
My whole world collapsed last night
My star can't shine tonight
Another time I've tried to walk along this icy way
Another time I've lost my balance
When my eyes turned gray
Another day began to dawn in my mind
Another day without a sun to shine
Calling the sun
My whole world collapsed last night
My star can't shine tonight
All the things I ever knew
Seem to be without importance
For my intent for another start
Go away from here
Just go away from here
My sun might shine for you
Calling the sun
My whole world collapsed last night
My star can't shine tonight"

I saw, I saw so many lights
I saw so many people
Without a look in their faces
Come on to the sea
To the sea of tears
I went to where nothing else moved
I went to the sea of sadness
I went to where nothing else moved
I went to a sea of tears
There was a girl in a white dress
Her face did look so unhappy
Was she the queen of the night?
She had no voice to cry..."
1847,fall,2007,dreadful-shadows,Rock,"Your burial garment - so fresh and, oh, so white
Your eyes are closed and on your face a smile
No trace of sorrows and your suffering
You're looking more alive than ever in your life
Fall - the morning comes
Forgotten are the reasons why you died
Forgotten all your screams, the tears you cried
No word about your courage, why it failed
The words could be sent to anyone but you
Fall - the morning comes
Dance with me until unconsciusness
You're in my arms
Times of pleasure return to reality
Your tears are dried
Die with me so irrevocably
I'm in your arms
Times of pleasure return to reality
Your tears are dried
Fall - your morning comes"
1848,the-figures-of-disguise,2007,dreadful-shadows,Rock,"Awoke in darkness, my trembling hands are scarred
A brown crust on my fingernails
A sudden pain in my back reminds me of my dream last night
I'm close to you and take your hand
You trust in me but I wouldn't feel safe
A vampire's heart can't abstain from loving you to death
The marks on my wrist make me shiver
When I went to bed they weren't there
My shirt's torn apart, dried blood adorns the sleeves
I'm feeling empty inside
Murders at night
I freeze to death again
The urge will be victorious again
I'm burning once again
The figures of disguise
What happened last night? I can't remember
What have I done when I thought I'm asleep?
The wounds burn, a light wind brings relief - an irony
I look into your eyes, embrace your neck
A graceful sight, I'm choking more and more
Your fingernails furrow my skin
I smile - suddenly you are still
My desperation never comes to an end
I wash my hands and I'm mirrored
The shapeless face on my body smiles at me
My victim of last night"
1849,the-drowning-time,2007,dreadful-shadows,Rock,"The bare wall is damp, a layer of mould is covering every joint
The pipes are leaking, it's dripping onto my ragged bed
Minutes seem to be days and days are years, so what am I waiting for? Too many
things have changed, too many words have lost their sense
The days will be mine when rivers rise
But now I'm stumbling on the edge of our life
The last words to the drowning sun
The light was bright enough to believe
That we could lose ourselves in feelings, but we failed
The last words to the drowning sun
Today I reached the door with my last ounce of strength
It was like opening secret gates to another world
The first time I've seen the sun again, since you passed away
My life without you can't be a life - a waste of time
The days will be mine when rivers rise
But now I'm stumbling on the edge of our life
The last words to the drowning sun
The light was bright enough to believe
That we could lose ourselves in feelings, but we failed
The last words to the drowning sun"
1850,homeless,2007,dreadful-shadows,Rock,"Trying to forget all the words that wander 'round in my mind
Seeing no more goodness at all, it's only hatred I find
I don't want to be the bereaved of a forgotten world
And I don't want to lay me down to fall in endless sleep
I'm drying all my tears; I try to wipe away my sorrows and grief
Right now I'm walking to the land where I find the words that I can receive,
To a place where I can give and understand and forgive and forget
But I'm walking to nowhere, 'cos a place like that doesn't exist
Tell me why do I pray to the lord?
There is no beauty and passion in this world;
Why do I love you, why do I believe,
Why can't I go or slowly disappear?
Now I reached the point where I say I don't care anymore,
I'm sure I'll never find all the things I was looking for,
To hell with your promises, it's a lie
I am waiting for the end I'll get wings and then I'll fly..."
1851,exile,2007,dreadful-shadows,Rock,"Contradiction in my thoughts is the barrier of my life
I cannot jump that nigh to overcome
Too many hidden ways - their destination is the same
Which way is wrong and which is right
Sometimes I wish I had a choice
To end or to begin
Sometimes I wish I could live on my own
But nothing's breaking through the walls inside
All the dreams remain behind
All the voices fade away
I'm falling into nothingness of life
I don't care about the time
I don't need to understand
There's no confusion in my mind but the clarity is gone
I hope you'll never ask about tomorrow
My abandoned ship is carried by the current
I cannot fight against it and I cannot force it
Sometimes I wish I had a choice
To end or to begin
Sometimes I wish I could live on my own
But nothing's breaking through the walls inside

Nothing's changed and nothing's evolved anywhere
Too many voices call your name
And my own is much too weak
To be heard, to be felt
And I'm dragged down the waterfall
Disarmed, defenseless
All the flowers are withered
And everything has turned to gray
The rain can't wash away my tears
Into the deepest marsh I falling
And my struggling only helps
To force my suffocation
And I'm dragged down the waterfall
Disarmed, defenseless
When I saw you for the last time
Your eyes were cold and dull
Why can't you stay with me forever
Why did you have to go
Oh, you were wilting much too fast
Your scars will never heal
I never knew how much I love you
Can I wake the dead
Can I cry if I could
Will the sun ever shine on you again
Can you see me lying here
Don't you see me hiding here
It's too deep, much too deep to cry
And I'm dragged down the waterfall
Disarmed, defenseless"

The diary of my life is burnt
I can't pretend, can't drive your face away
Your intimate voice is dumb
I'll always see your wistful eyes
The tears you cried will never dry
Every word you said comes back again
Spread your wings and fly
Dance with my shade
Like the leaves in that stormy night you passed away
All my zest for life is gone
The scenes of yesterdays will never fade
Too many words are left unsaid
I'll spread my wings to be with you"

But I never found someone at the end
All the dreadful dreams I dreamt
But I always woke up in the morning
To the headless and legless I went
But what did they want to tell me
In the water of a deep blue sea I swam
But I was not drowned
In the light of the fire on that place
I've seen that burning face
In the fire of that lightning place
I've seen my face, but I'm still alive
All the silly games I played with you
All attacks that I survived I don't care
And I stood on the top of the highest rocks
Never been so close to eternity
All the valleys of death - didn't try to avoid
But no sunbeam met my face again
As my body was ice it melted slow
But the night was cold, I'm Still Alive
In the light of the fire on that place
I've seen that burning face
In the fire of that lightning place
I've seen my face, but I'm still alive"

A coat of ice is covering me
A breath of decay drifts away

Give in our will and awake""
Paralyzed by agony
When bones broke through my skin
My splintering skull was the last thing I felt
I leave my mortal remains
""A spiral of darkness will lead to your home
Open the gate to that world
The soil is your father, don't try to escape
Give in our will and awake"""

Fog flowed over her body
Like a haze of a thousand painful tears

Death is the release
Death is the eternity
Death is the origin of a new life
Oh it's the place of memories,
Memories of the many sufferings
Of the lots of anguishes
And disappointments of lonelyness
Of lonelyness and remorse
You'll be delivered of the anguishes and
Disappointments of lonelyness
Delivered of all the sufferings
Which have drilled into your heart like glowing arrows"

You have lost again"

I don't know where I am, don't know how I came here
I try to get up, but I'm paralyzed
The last snow is melting, it's march
It's always cold in march, isn't it?
I'm trying hard to remember
What happened yesterday, or was it the day before
I see blood beside me and on my hands
I see your face
It's raining heavier and life is coming back to my body
I try to find the moon, but it's too cloudy
I try to move - and I can move
I try to make out where I am
There's a lake with silent waves and there are trees
I see your body with dislocated limbs
And I see your face
""My shivering hands vainly try to touch your face
Something holds me back approaching your face...""
Your eyes are open, are you crying?
But these tears are rainwater filling your eyes
You don't move, you don't answer, you don't react at all
It smells like burnt rubber, I see a car
And I remember it was ours
And now the fog is clearing
Very slowly I begin to understand
Begin to understand
We wanted to end our lives
Of sorrows and agony
We wanted to escape
And now you're dead
Now you're dead and I'm alive
Why do I live when you're dead
Why should I live when you're dead"

Not far from here
And the colours turn to black
Like a tear of tar - in your rigid eyes

Where we stared into the stars
I touch the water and I see your face
And your rigid eyes
One more time I see you die
There's no salvation
Something breaks you deep inside
It's the end of your dissolution

Far above my head
Like an epitome of beauty I see a face
With your rigid eyes"

It collapsed above my head
A cyclone sweeps me away
And avalanches plunge
A craving for delight - no remembrance
We're neither lost nor found
White walls hold me in chains
The axis got out of place
A child is dancing to the sound
Of detonating bombs
A craving for delight - no remembrance
We're neither lost nor found
A raging torrent pulls me down
And I don't attempt to hold my breath
The glass is shattering on the ground
It cuts into my skin, but no blood is pouring
A craving for delight - no remembrance
We're neither lost nor found
I see the children again
It smiles
It burns"

Reveals the time gone by
These days seem so far away
Why did I return
Your rooms didn't change a lot
But the things have lost your soul
Your scent was replaced by cold
Which is seized my body
The vortex was much too fast
But we weren't afraid of falling
The blindness of fatal dreams
Remains
The door opens and you're standing there
Your hair is wet from rain
You're looking scared and distraught
But you can't speak anymore
A window shutters and you laugh
Your face is so unreal
Your eyes reveal the senseless fight
You'll never escape
The vortex was much too fast

The blindness of fatal dreams
Remains"

What the people say
As you ran away from here
You were alone on your way
You are over the worst
After your lonely fight
You don't know what's left or right
But come on, come on, come on
For a hope it's too late
You are over the worst..."

I'll never see when you cry all day
I fall asleep, but you still got my spirit
I'll always sleep until we meet again

Eternity took place in me"

No river will flow, no fire will burn - anymore
The wind has lost its power
Another piece of the universe is gone
Grey stones bury your will to live
Dusk

Breathing clearest air
I've found everything I've lost before

Noone catches me, noone stops me anymore"

No way to get me out of this or to return
The wind will blow my face away
No love will last, just endless calm
Tomorrow is the strangest word for me
Soon I'll be forgotten
I'm drifting weightlessly in time, all alone
I was suffocated by your kiss, I'm buried again"
1867,desolated-home,2007,dreadful-shadows,Rock,"I watched the houses burn, a bloodstained kind of brightness
The last breath of grace and elegance is done
The dead are lugged away, but they won't find their silence
The verges fade, another time has begun
A better time will come they say to reassure themselves
Another day will bring the light - but they are ignorant
In the cradle of their carelessness
Burning flesh, burning skin
Another raindrop burns their loathsome eyes.
The diaries are blank, they went too far
They can't return to their desolated homes
No life anymore in the rooms of the girl who lived next door
Desolated home
I watched the houses burn, the trees were full of ashes
Just like snowflakes darken the sky
No better time will come they know
The truth becomes certainty
They won't see the sun, they won't feel the light - no more
The loss of insincerity
The loss of humand souls
The diaries are blank, they went too far
They can't return to their desolated homes
No life anymore in the rooms of the girl who lived next door
Desolated home"

to despise her now,
On her way
Give me one good reason
to be sorry for her now,
On her way
We heard an echo of a helpless voice
A child was screaming far, so far away
The girl beside me didn't move anymore
The waves drowned this little voice"

The long road we covered seems to end right here
We're so close, but too far
There is something better
Something free and new
There's another home for the lost
Where our dreams come true
We're vagrants in space
We don't care about the dreams around us
Vagrants in space
We don't need deceitfulness to live
We have tried too long, we have died too long
We have cried too long at all
We believed too long, understood too long
Now our time has come
There is something better
Something free and new

Go on, your way never ends
I won't light the stars, I shroud you in my darkness
Welcome to my own paradize.
The trees reveal the secrets they were hiding
The leaves don't dance anymore
Don't shed a tear, you were never lying
But much too late I understood.
So here I am, I will always wait here

Now your conscience is clear
In the morning when I wipe my brow
Wipe the miles away
I like to think than I can be so willed
And never do what you say
I'll never hear you
And never do what you say
Look my eyes are just holograms
Look your love has drawn red from my hands
From my hands you know you'll never be
More than twist in my sobriety
More than twist in my sobriety
We just poked a little empty pie
For the fun the people had at night
Late at night don't need hostility
The timid smile and pause to free
I don't care about their different thoughts
Different thoughts are good for me
Up in arms and chaste and whole
All God's children took their toll
Look my eyes are just holograms
Look your love has drawn red from my hands
From my hands you know you'll never be
More than twist in my sobriety
More than twist in my sobriety
Cup of tea take time to think, yeah
Time to risk a life, a life, a life
Sweet and handsome, soft and porky
You pig out 'til you've seen the light
Pig out 'til you've seen the light
Half the people read the papers
Read them good and well
Pretty people, nervous people
People have got to sell
News you have to sell
Look my eyes are just holograms
Look your love has drawn red from my hands
From my hands you know you'll never be

And you drink the blood of life
And you vomit

For the darkening of every light, suffocation of every cry
Bells of death started to play
Depreciation of time, the explanation of lies
Drowning words can't promise delight
The years of secrecy are gone
Trembling hands call for a Lord
The inversion of time, the realization of lies
Burning the shrouds
Of your illuminated souls
It's the embers under our feet
The trails of blood lead me to your shrine
It fades away
Freezing blood under my skin
The futility of efforts, obedience subverts the reason
Words descend into a haze
The inversion of time, depreciation of lies"

I think you won't hear it

I'll come through the mirror
To be with you"

A ray of sun comes into my room
The sleepless nights of former years are ending
And every day falls into a gloom
Where is the torment in my brain - it's so silent
Where is the screaming of my soul
I can't stand it anymore
I'm drowning
I'll be dancing with your soul - in our ancient way
I'll be kissing you today - and our hope is granted
Every minute I am wasting here is agonizing pain
Why should I hesitate to leave
I'm sick of escaping from that cold - I'm still running
The torn thoughts destroyed my mind
The emptiness causes fear and isolation
Transience seems to be a lie"

But I still know how it sounds
Now I'm sitting down at this stone
Where we were waiting for the day
The sun is cold and heaven's grey
It seems like yesterday
When I was at your grave
Where will I see you again
Hoping for coincidence
When will I kiss you again
Feeling no more alone
I watch the sun it passes by
I don't feel the heat anymore
'cos now you're gone
But I am buried deep beneath your feet
And I can't see tomorrow"

Seconds seem to be hours
These hollow beams are bent like blades of grass
They'd never have carried weight before
The railings are destroyed
I'm just a step away
Is this my life?
Is this my life?
Wherever I've gone
The end was always
The futility of delight
Whatever I've said
In my words was always
The futility of delight
Now the bridge is breaking apart
I cannot get a hold of anything
There's nothing within my reach at all
I'm falling weightlessly
Just a step too far
This is my life
This is my life
Wherever I've gone

The moonlight is fragile
Like the coat of glass all around you
I often injured myself
The scars can not heal anymore
How often I collapsed when I desperately waited for a sign
All you ought to do was to free myself from my suffering and pain
Hopelessly I wander about in town
The scenes repeat time after time
I'm standing alone on the negative of the photograph of my life
Why is it only the worst I can feel?
Why can't I laugh and be glad, just like all of these fools?
The severest way I had to go

You breathed in your despair

In times when you were young and strong
You could embrace the world
You've been so fearless and so sure
Courageous inside
Flies dance around the same old lie

Another time we had to see - we are creeping worms in space
Too many disappointments made me disintegrate
I'm losing hold, losing control - and my world collapsed""

Immortal power seized your body
I left you when you fell asleep

In endless fights against myself my world collapsed"""

Now she perceives me and she comes to me
She touches my face, her fingers are cold, are cold, are cold

Now we stand here side by side
And we're waiting for the next black night
You give me a smile and you say:
""Now we start our second life!""
And when the sunset comes
We kiss that bloody life good-bye
And we take off and fly away...

Staring out of classroom windows
I don't think I'll ever be happy

I was too dumb to settle down
So, I packed up and I left town
On a sunshine bus
Wondering where it all went wrong
On a flimsy wing and a prayer
I followed my heart everywhere

Eating little packets of Sultanas
Licking chocolate off their chubby little fingers
And I don't know why
It is they scare me but they do
And the thing that really frightens me
Is that all my friends from school
Are turning into monsters
Picking patterns out for curtains
Making friends with all the other monsters
Pushing little baby monsters
Around the shops in prams

Peeping out from under parked cars
In multi-storey car park
Evil little eyes like fairy lights
Blinking in the dark

Making out with other monsters
Picking sweet corn out of their teeth
Dipping pissy little fingers
In the pick 'n' mix

I packed my antihistamines and Tupperware drums
A harmonica and a box guitar
In a canvas covered wagon stuff with apples and with guns

And no one ever signed our stupid country disco band

I suppose, this'll have to do
For the time being
Fishes and worms
Frozen under the ice
Sometimes, it hurts
So much, it feels nice
I'm afraid of growing old
And being on my own
So, I'm putting my country shoulder
To the wheel
I'm afraid of letting go
Of everything I know
So I just sadly float
Away down stream
Smiling at the leaves
Chewing butter beans
And wondering what dreams
Are made of fur

Fur too soft for words

Si pienso en ti otra vez
No fuiste tÃº quien se marchÃ³, que va,
Fui yo, fui yo quien no te supe retener
No fuiste tÃº quien dijo no
Y te pienso sin querer
Y hoy me he levantado y ya perdÃ­ la cuenta
CuÃ¡nto puse de mi parte
O en que parte de este cuento fue
Que yo te perdÃ­
Y me doy la vuelta imaginÃ¡ndome
Que en cualquier momento vas a aparecer
SerÃ¡ que ya tengo que olvidar
A ver lo que hay que hacer
Si aÃºn te puedo ver
Si aÃºn te puedo oler
Si aÃºn me lates en la sien
PerdÃ³name, entiÃ©ndeme
Si pienso en ti otra vez
No fuiste tÃº quien se marchÃ³, que va,
Fui yo, fui yo que no te supe retener

Y desde un reproductor
Los beatles son su pasin
Y suea con escenarios
Mientras le cambia la luz
Del rojo al verde no hay
Mucho tiempo para soar

Grita la gente al verlo
Sobre su espalda una
Esposa, y un hijo que alimentar

Lo que pueda soar
El pelo largo hasta el hombro
Eso no se usa ya
Pero a Louis no le importa

Que aun no pierde las ganas
De podernos cantar

Hablarte de sexo
Se te subieron los colores al rostro
Y te fuiste.

Against a Jungle primeval green,

No bangles or chain, wearin' broken shoe
Seventy-five cent bottle perfume.

All the while I was cunning like a rat,
Smilin gaily, looked her in the eye,
I felt in my pocket, the Love me or Die
My past history, one to behold,
I studied magic from days of old,
Membership, secret societies,
Power and wealth in my family
But Matilda, Darling,
Why you don't take my wedding ring,
Like a demon under the floor,
I buried the hoodoo down the back door.
Lawd, word broke through the town,
That a fever strike Matilda down,
Nine thirty, the doctor arrive,
Priest come runnin, quarter to five.
Standin in the weeds early next day,
I saw the meat wagon rollin away,
I seen Matilda layin in the back,
Her old mother wearin a suit of black"

The nether side of town
They will not pass this way again
So here in the night
Leave your home it's time for running
Out of the light
I see the hosts of Mohammed coming
The Holy Sister bars her doors against the East
Her house has stood too long divided
The uninvited guests are breaking up the feast
She may not bid them leave again
So here in the night
Leave your home it's time for running
Out of the light
I see the hosts of Mohammed coming
I dreamed I stood like this before
And I'm sure the words that I heard then
Were much the same
It's just an old Greek tragedy they're acting here
Held over by popular acclaim
So here in the night
Leave your home it's time for running
Out of the light
I see the hosts of Mohammed coming"

To the heart of the bistro
Among the shadows and the low low lights
I can find a release-o
My favorite waitress will be here tonight
I love the way she wears those fish-net tights
She's so hard to resist-o
in this Mondo Sinistro
She picks a menu up and throws it my way
With a flick of her wrist-o
I'm sitting hoping that the night might take
A romantic twist-o
I order chicken and a chilled chablis
She brings me grapefruit and a cup of tea
She's a little Mephisto
In this Mondo Sinistro
I say I really love her dark brown eyes
And the way that they tease-o
I tell her everytime she passes by
I grow weak in the knees-o
I ask her would she like to come and play
She blows my candle out and walks away
I just cease to exist-o

2001,accident-on-3rd-street,2007,al-stewart,Rock,"Linda was killed last Saturday about fifteen blocks from where she lives
In a car crash, people gathered around the graveside friends and relatives dressed in black
Preacher mumblin' how she's bound to go to Heaven
The service started at half-past ten, it was all over by eleven
They say it's God's to give, and God's to take away,
But why He happened to pick Linda on a Saturday night, no one could say.
Maybe it's just one of those things
One of those things
They found guy the who did it, he had the lobotomy and the chicken eyes,
And he gazed around the courtroom with a kind of vague suprise
Reminded me of one of those Vikings with the long-handled swords
The kind of guy even Joan Baez would not feel non-violent towards
Said he wasn't looking, maybe he had had a bit too much
It was dark, it was raining, he didn't see the light or some such
It was just one of those things,
One of those things.
I asked my local guru the situation and he gave me this reply
While pointing a bony finger up into the general direction of the sky:
""Get on with your own life, it is not ours to reason why""
Said he used to worry about it once when he was young
Now he doesn't even bother to try
He left me with a feeling that what he said was basically sound
Like a black hole in space, or philosophy, useless but profound
Just one of those things,
One of those things.
Tonight I'm gonna take myself down to my local cafe
Gonna get smashed out of my mind, gonna waste myself away
Gonna drink and drink and sink into that dark abyss
I wanna be just like that Viking, I wanna know if ignorance is truly bliss.
Linda's in the cold ground, won't see her anymore
Somewhere out on the highway tonight, the drunken engines roar
It's just one of those things,
One of those things."

The saturation point's been reached
Can't soak up any more regrets

You seem to be like someone else

somewhere in a troubled land.
They came with no greeting;
left without a shaken hand.
Nearby the town sleeping
was unaware of what was done.
No need for watchkeeping,
they'll be gone before the sun.
You may not see just where the sense is
in the actions of the State.
You may not know the consequencses
of their actions till too late.
The rival factions still debate
as shadows gather at your gate.
It was a night meeting:
independent, prearranged,
to get a signed treaty,
force the government to change.
Secret diplomacy without the means to make their policy prevail.
Meanwhile the powers that be behind the scenes have guaranteed to see
them fail.
You seem beyond the jurisdiction
of the democratic powers.
You do not see the contradiction
of the watchmen in the towers,
you turn your back as night devours
the final chance, the final hours.
It was a night meeting:
these are men who won't be missed.
Their lives were just fleeting:
they don't offically exist."

He met with a giri in the spring
And something about him just turned her around
As though she were caught on a string
And being so young they held on to each other
To see what the moment might bring
He loved her then in a secretive way
Not showing his care or his need
She stayed beside him and looked to the day
He would somehow begin to be free
In the chill of the night she would hold him and say
This is how they always should be
Rocks in the ocean, waves on the sea
Keep it in mind,
If love comes unsatisfied, don't forget me
Don't forget me
And so he come to depend on her more
Though the lesson was still to be learned,
Taking for granted the gift that she gave
As though it were something he'd earned
And she for her part growing slowly away
From a love that was never returned
Then came the day that he never foresaw
When he woke to find she was gone
He followed her then to the ends of the world
To tell her how much he'd been wrong
But the more he called her, the more she was lost
Leaving only the words of her song
Rocks in the ocean, waves on the sea
Keep it in mind,
If love comes unsatisfied, don't forget me
Don't forget me
He still listens out for her foot on the stair
As he looks for her down through the years
And the friends that he had have all left one by one
For their words weren't reaching his ears
He chooses instead now to wander alone
To a song that only he hears
Rocks in the ocean, waves on the sea
Keep it in mind,
If love comes unsatisfied, don't forget me

And now he's never gonna get his statue up in Red Square
I remember Krushchev, the old man said
He had real strength in his jaw
The setting sun would turn his skull pale red
But now they've packed him off to the store
He used to know how to stir things up back then
Banging his shoe on the table at the UN
He said he'd bury the west again and again
But now he's never gonna get his statue up in Red Square
Too bad about Lenin, the old man sighed
he really had quite a run
For seventy years he was idolized

The enemy's face is so hard to see,
sometimes it seems that I see him in you,
sometimes in me.
Who can it be?
No use consulting the prophets and leaders,
they all disagree.
Russians and Americans,
here's a song for you, who carry the weight of the world on your head.
Russians and Americans,
tell me if it's true, you really believe all the things that you've said,
the red-white-and-blue running into the red.
>From the wars of Europe, the pilgrim fathers set off with their hopes
and their bond,
some settled down by the coast, others cross the mountains and into the
flatlands beyond.
>From the scramble and dust of Muscovite streets,
merchants develop the trade routes,
and open the Door to the East.
Pioneer waves
choked by the cold breath of winter,
and baked by the heat of the day.
Russians and Americans,
passing through the fire of revolution and coming of age.
Russians and Americans,
driven by desire, two players push to the front of the stage,
the whole world now watches each move that you make.
Two runners caught in the thrill of the race,
the finishing line is as far as the stars that the satellites chase,
why quicken the pace?
Why does it seem that you choose to lose reason
before losing face?
Russians and Americans,
driven by the past, the third world moves in the shadows you cast.
Russians and Americans,
can turn the world to dust, so much to live for, so much undiscussed,
so much in common and so little trust.
>From the streets of Athens and Rome the voices still echo to crumbling walls.
Look to the past and remember that no empire rises that sooner or later
won't fall.
Forever the changes we still have to face,
some people say a country is more and idea than a place.
Though nothing is safe,
we still choose the mark that we leave on the open canvas of space.
Russians and Americans,
maybe you should see into the heart of the world, not it's head.
Russians and Americans,
if you want to be the beat of the world, better mind where you tread,
the footsteps of history are left where you step.
So here we stand at the edge of 1984."

In a kingdom lost in time.
And in the forests of evening the archer is bending a bow,
And I see you bring him bread and wine.
Down the ligneous years the invaders have taken these lands,
And bent you to their will.
And the murmurous fade of the ancients and all that they had,
But the magic lingers round you still.
Oh who will walk the stony roads of Merlin's time
And keep a watch along the boarder line?
And who will hear the legends passed in song and rhyme,
Upon the Shepard's pipes of Merling's time?"

You're halfway to the door
The voice said 'get out while you can,
There's just 1O minutes, nothing more'
Time only for the essentials
Better gather them and run
The false name inside the passport,
The gold bars and the gun
And once again they've come out of the past
And though your mind is cool your heart is beating fast
You've been through it all before
Each time you wish a little more that you could ask
""What do you want from me?
What do you need from me?
There's no rest for the running man
Why can't you let him be?'
It's a long and twisting journey
From the sweeping northern plains
To the outcrops of the jungle
Bowed beneath the tropic rains
In the customs hall the officer
Takes you to one side
And his eyes reveal no feeling
As you hand over the bribe
And once again you've bought a little time
And once again you're fading out of sight
Still the fox is growing older
As he calls over his shoulder to the night:
""What do you want from me?
What do you need from me?
There's no rest for the running man
Why can't you let him be?""
Here, come over here
Beneath a sympathetic moon
We'll sit and talk over old times without a fear
Another beer, from the cafes of the night
The tumbling rhythms of guitars ring loud and clear
One by one they've nailed the others
But you always got away
What it is that keeps you just that step ahead
No one can say
In one last raid the agents
Of the dawn break down the door
Of a house where you were standing
Maybe just an hour before
And still the thread continues to unwind
You take the hidden roads that only you can find
And should they come upon your tracks
There's just a question hanging back you left behind
""What do you want from me?
What do you need from me?
No rest for the running man
Why can't you let him be?""

Living only day to day
I left the rose as quiet as the night

Looking round for a better way to live
She traded in her caravan for gold
Pretty things to have and hold
Always wanting more than I could give

But I never thought Id fall
I said You're the one who had the crystal ball

On the edge just to slip back again
From Ellis Island, day after day
From Ellis Island, dreams slip away
Ah well I've heard it said
If you just use your head
You can make your fortune here
One lucky break and that's all it would take
But it never seems to be near
Another day, another ship pulls into harbor
And the crowd spills down the gangway
Clutching their suitcases tight
Blinking in the sunlight at the door of the new world
They hold the handrail
With all the post thrown behind
Caught in between now and forever
Wondering just what lies ahead
Each one is waiting and hoping
The door will be open to them
On Ellis Island, day after day
On Ellis Island, time slips away
From Ellis Island, day after day
From Ellis Island, dreams slip away
Save our souls, river of darkness over me
Save our souls, lost on the dark uncharted sea"
2022,anniversary,2005,al-stewart,Rock,"This is the day you disappeared
Your hand was steady and I know that your mind was clear
You left a note up on the shelf
Saying ""I would rather be anyone but myself""
You took a simple ride across the Great Divide
You left the television on in you room
Your friends were sad although they said ""I told you so""
You never really did fit into your skin
The small annoying things you do
All seemed so cute and entertaining when they were new
This kind of honeymoon can't last
I think you knew you wore your welcome out much too fast
I was surprised to see you played the lottery
Your winning ticket you won't need anymore
You were in such a rush you never stopped to check
You jacket pocket on your way out the door"
2023,somewhere-in-england-1915,2005,al-stewart,Rock,"On the platform of an old railway station I enter a dream
And a couple is saying goodbye through the noise and the steam But it's just Brief Encounter my mind is trying to rerun
And I wait for the poignant finale but the dream has moved on And the train has turned into a shlp that is sailing away And the platform is a beach full of shells under silvery grey And the girl on the beach is an English Prime Minister's daughter
And she watches the ship disappear at the edge of the water
And it feeis like the pain in her heart will be never-ending
And everyone feels this way in the beginning And she watches the shlp disappear for the length of a sigh
And the maker of rhymes on the deck who is going to die
In the corner of some foreign field that will make him so famous
As a light temporarily shines to illumine his pages
Then the scene has changed once again: now it's moonlight on wire And the night is disturbed by a sudden volcano of fire
And a skull in a trench gazes up open-mouthed at the moon
And the poets are now Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon
And nobody talks any more about losing and winning
And everyone feels that way in the beginning And I'm up in the air looking down at a girl on a bed
She's lying asleep on her side with a book at her head
And it's someone who left long ago; was it something I said? And I hope that she was reading King Lear but it's Twelfth Night instead
Now the girl and the beach and the train and the ship are all gone
And the calendar up on the wall says it's ninety years on
I go out into the yard where the newspaper waits
There's a man on the cover we all know, defying the fates
And he seems very sure as he offers up hls opinion
Well everyone feels like this in the beginning When you feel that the pain in your heart will be unending
Everyone feels this way in the beginning If you feel that the pain in your heart will be never-ending
Well everyone feels that way in the beginning"
2024,out-in-the-snow,2005,al-stewart,Rock,"I walked out in the snow
And left no mark upon the ground I trod
The sky, heavy and low
The exhalation of an Arctic god
And I heard words meant for no one
In the air, words out of nowhere
And I saw all at once at my feet
Unexpectedly, a shadow play
I broke off on a floe
And drifted aimlessly a hundred miles
The wind, beginning to blow
Carried me forward on this boat of ice
And I saw things half imagined
Far away, pictures and pageants
That were lost in a moment like words
From a langauge that I never knew
And this voyage seemed to be haunted
By a soul, lost and unwanted
Destined to journey through time
Always covered in a coat of white
I walked out in the snow
Never knowing what I came here for
A dream from so long ago
But we don't talk about it anymore"

Piles of CDs that are eager to please
Still asserting themselves
There's something in the morning light
That is muted and soft down on Beacon Street
Then a bar or two of classical music
Will waft through the air
Newspaper adverts will usher the future your way
Indian teas and then take-out Chinese
At the end of the day
Shadows on furniture cast by the light of the moon
You've got a fridge full of food
You won't need to go anywhere soon
When it's time to start again
They will welcome you in down on Beacon Street

Now and then on their own"

Anything that you want, anything that you do

That my ancestors made some generations ago
They're wearing the lastest clothes in a nautical way
The Suez Canal close behind is frozen in time
The deck crews star out of a mime
And they seem to be considering me
Here on my Egyptian couch
O the life on Edwardian steamships
Is measured and slow, while down below
There are fires that shudder and clang and thunder
And sweat-caked in smoke, and cauldrons to stoke
To send the ship on her way
Tasting the salt and the spray
And a century later I scan the equator
From my Egyptian couch
And the news every day brings
Contains the strangest of things
But with confident smilesw my forebears decline
To gaze into the wings
So they look from the photographs
And they're curious now, wondering how we turned out
Let's say like the Chinese adage
We're living our lives in interesting times"

His meaning wasn't clear

Not to my majordomo
So I sent my acolyte to further our relations
And he engaged your ministers in lengthy conversations
One or two were willingto discuss the matter frankly
We then received your advocate
Who told me that you thanked me
Also my majordomo
Also my majordomo
I therefore told my counselor to offer my best wishes
And he was greeted cordially with smiles and festive dishes
I further was encouraged by a note in your handwriting
Delivered by your confidant, it seemed you were inviting
My plenipotentiary with great felicitations
To join your chief of protocol in swift negotiations
But something must have happened
A secret door had closed then
The word from my ambassador was you were indisposed
And could not meet my majordomo
There's nothing I can do now

And the farm boys wait for joyrides in the clearing

She's wrapped around some stranger, hanging on for life

Foot soldiers with their guns coming

Up from underneath,

From Africa the winds they talk of changes coming
The torches flare up in the night
The hand that sets the farms alight
Has spread the word to those who're waiting on the border
In the village where I grew up
Nothing seems the same
Still you never see the change from day to day
And no-one notices the customs slip away
Late last night the rain was knocking at my window
I moved across the darkened room and in the lampglow
I thought I saw down in the street
The spirit of the century
Telling us that we're all standing on the border
In the islands where I grew up
Nothing seems the same
It's just the patterns that remain
An empty shell
But there's a strangeness in the air you feel too well
The fishing boats go out across the evening water
Smuggling guns and arms across the Spanish border
The wind whips up the waves so loud
The ghost moon sails among the clouds
Turns the rifles into silver on the border

Goes sinking from my eyes like a stone
A king shall fall and put to death by the English parliament shall be
Fire and plague to London come in the year of six and twenties three
An emperor of France shall rise who will be born near Italy
His rule cost his empire dear, Napoleon his name shall be
From Castile does Franco come and the Government driven out shall be
An English king seeks divorce, and from his throne cast down is he
One named Hister shall become a captain of Greater Germanie
No law does this man observe and bloody his rise and fall shall be
Man, man, your time is sand, your ways are leaves upon the sea
I am the eyes of Nostradamus, all your ways are known to me
Man, man, your time is sand, your ways are leaves upon the sea
I am the eyes of Nostradamus, all your ways are known to me
In the new lands of America three brothers now shall come to power
Two alone are born to rule but all must die before their hour
Two great men yet brothers not make the north united stand
Its power be seen to grow, and fear possess the eastern lands
Three leagues from the gates of Rome a Pope named Pol is doomed to die
A great wall that divides a city at this time is cast aside

to show you when the time is nigh

All the way to Chinatown
See it come from miles around

You quoted Shakespeare

Do you remember the time we were young?
Lowly, lowly, low
Outside the window the frosty moonlight hung
On the midnight snow
So we pulled our scarves around our faces in the night
Huddled on the doorsteps where the fairylights shone bright
Singing Christmas carols while our breath hung in the light
It all comes back like yesterday
It almost seems like yesterday
Do you remember the changes as we grew?
Slowly, slowly, slow
Sneaking in the back way into movies after school
For the evening show
Chasing skinny blue jean girls across the building-site
Checking out the dance floor while the band played ""Hold Me Tight""
See the blonde one over there: I bet she'd be alright
It all comes back like yesterday
It almost seems like yesterday
While I talked he sat and he never made a sound
Staring at the glass beside me
Hey old friend, tell me what's on your mind?
Silence grows on you like ivy
Ivy
Do you remember the church across the sands?
Holy, holy, ho
You stood outside and planned to travel the lands
Where the pilgrims go
So you packed your world up inside a canvas sack
Set off down the highway with your rings and Kerouac
Someone said they saw you in Nepal a long time back
Tell me why you look away
Don't you have a word to say?
He said, ""I don't remember ... I Don't want to remember
In fact I've heard too much already
I don't want to think, just leave me here to drink
Wrapped up in the warmth of New York City
Oh, oh, it seems you just don't know
And you just don't understand me
I've got no use for the tricks of modern times
They tangle all my thoughts like ivy
Ivy""
So I left him, and I went out to the street
Lowly, lowly, low
Where the red light girls were coming after me
Forty dollar show
All across the city's heart the lights were coming on
The hotel lift softly hummed a Cole Porter song
If I went to look for him I knew he would be gone

A photograph of yesterdayAnd far off in a deserted part of town
The shadows like a silent army
Flooded out the rooms in pools of blue and brown
And stuck to all the walls like ivy

To make you see, this is the place to be

There were old tin cans and cats and the doors were crusted
With mud and leaves and names carved long ago
And the rails go on for ever in a silver trail to the setting sun

As here once again they strut and they fret their hour
I see those half-familiar faces in the second row
Ghost-like with the footlights in their eyes
But where or when we met like this last time, I just don't know
It's like a chord that rings and never dies for infinity
And now these figures in the wings with all their restless tunes
Are waiting around for someone to call their names
They walk the backstage corridors and prowl the dressing rooms
And vanish to specks of light in the picture-frames
But did they move upon the stage a thousand years ago
In some play in Paris or Madrid
And was I there among them then, in some travelling show
And is it all still locked inside my head for infinity
And some of you are harmonies to all the notes I play
Although we may not meet still you know me well
While others talk in secret keys and transpose all I say
And nothing I do or try can get me through the spell
So one more time we'll dim the lights and ring the curtain up
And play again like all the times before
But far behind the music you can almost hear the sounds
Of laughter like the waves upon the shores of infinity"

But he never really found the time
And your TV mother with her cocktail eyes
Could never really reach your mind
So you fixed your star to a passing dream
And took a cocaine holiday
Now the years flow round you in a muddy stream
And you need another place to stay.

I know you must be there
Well, sometimes it seems impossible
That the game could get that rough
But the stage is set, the exit's barred
And the make-up won't come off
So you make your bow to the balcony
You light another cigarette
And the lights grow dim as the music starts
And it's easy to forget

2045,flying-sorcery,2006,al-stewart,Rock,"With your photographs of Kitty Hawk
And the biplanes on your wall
You were always Amy Johnson
From the time that you were small
No schoolroom kept you grounded
While your thoughts could get away
You were taking off in Tiger Moths
Your wings against the brush-strokes of the day
Are you there
On the tarmac with the winter in your hair
By the empty hangar doors you stop and stare
Leave the oil-drums behind you, they won't care
Oh, are you there
Oh, you wrapped me up in a leather coat
And you took me for a ride
We were drifting with the tail-wind
When the runway came in sight
The clouds came up to gather us
And the cockpit turned to white
When I looked the sky was empty
I suppose you never saw the landing-lights
Are you there
In your jacket with the grease-stain and the tear
Caught up in the slipstream of dare
The compass roads will guide you anywhere
Oh, are you there
The sun comes up on Icarus as the night-birds sail away
And lights the maps and diagrams
That Leonardo makes
You can see Faith, Hope and Charity
As they bank above the fields
You can join the flying circus
You can touch the morning air against your wheels
Are you there
Do you have a thought for me that you can share
Oh I never thought you'd take me unawares
Just call me if you ever need repairs
Oh, are you there"
2046,song-on-the-radio,2006,al-stewart,Rock,"I was making my way through the wasteland
The road into town passes through
I was changing the radio stations
With my mind on you
Oh your friends call you ""Lily Paloma""
But that's not the way that you are
It's too much of a gentle misnomer
For a shooting star
But you and me baby
I saw you there
Straight away I knew
There's really no hiding
I'll tell you right now
What we're gonna do
We'll go collecting the days
Putting the moments away
You're on my mind like a
Song on the Radio
I remember the first time I saw you
Alone in the dark with a drink
With a candle flame burning before you
And your thoughts closed in
You were staring out into the distance
Not seeming to hear what I said
Why did you put up such resistance
Like all the lights are red
'Cause you and me baby
I saw you there
Straight away I knew
There's really no hiding
I'll tell you right now
What we're gonna do
We'll go collecting the days
Putting the moments away
You're on my mind like a
Song on the Radio
I don't know what it was that was painful
But sometimes it's there in your face
There are times when you just look disdainful
Of the human race
Ah, but then on the wings of emotion
We circle each other in flight
Till together we roll like the ocean
In its bed at night
'Cause you and me baby
I saw you there
Straight away I knew
There's really no hiding
I'll tell you right now
What we're gonna do
We'll go collecting the days

2047,where-are-they-now,2006,al-stewart,Rock,"I sent my crack divisions through the early morning mist
When they fell on your positions you were powerless to resist
Encircling and probing for the weakness in your line
By night you were surrounded; your territory mine
I called for your surrender; this you swore you would not do
So I stormed the very fortress, you thought could shelter you
I held you then upon your knees and turned to give my thanks
To the regiments assembled in their ranks
CHORUS
Where are they now?
Where are they now?
I raised you to your feet, with your hand inside my own
We set off upon a journey, each together, each alone
In the days that followed oh our lives did overlap
I learned the contours of your body like the roads upon a map
You sweetened every evening, I savoured every day
Just when I was certain it would always be this way
You slipped beyond the reach of my outstretched fingertips
With all the kisses we'd placed upon your lips
CHORUS
Oh close. You're close
Someone, come shine a light
Oh near. So near
But just out of sight
I went in search of alchemy to resurrect the dead
Sent my spies to fathom out the secrets in your head
They said they heard your laughter
Spinning through the summer night
In the company of strangers
And your eyes were wild and bright
Though I grew reclusive and my days became withdrawn
I held the banner of our love, now tattered and forlorn
And swore that it would one day fly above us once again
To do this, I had my reasons then
CHORUS
Close. You're close
Once again, come shine a light
Oh near. So near
But just out of sight
Perhaps there are some passions that are tempered by the years
You reach accommodation, the intensity recedes
Some of this occurred to me the time I saw you last
Your face familiar in a way. Your voice out of the past
Every gamut of emotion shared from tenderness to rage
Fell away between us in the turning of that page
It seemed like only yesterday we swore that we'd be true
Two innocents believing that they knew
CHORUS"
2048,the-dark-and-rolling-sea,2006,al-stewart,Rock,"Oh, you slipped away from the harbor side
In the mornin bright and clear
And your sails were filled with the risin wind
And you laughed for all to hear
But you never glanced at the ragged dance
Of your lovers on the quay
Don't call on them when the winds rise high
On the dark and the rolling sea
Oh, you set your course for the furthest shores
And you never once looked back
And the flag you flew was a pirate cross
On a field of velvet black
And those landsmen who you but lately knew
Were left stranded on the lea
Don't call on them when the storm clouds rise
On the dark and the rolling sea
Oh, I have no need of a chart or creed
You told your waiting crew
For the winds of chance, they will bear us straight
And you spoke as though you knew
So you paid no mind to the warning signs
As you gave your words so free
Don't change your tack when the timbers crack
On the dark and the rolling sea
Now the thunder rails in the great mainsails
And the stars desert the skies
And the rigging strains as the hands of rain
Reach down to wash your eyes
And your oarsmen stands with his knife in hand
And his eyes spell mutiny
Don't call my name when your ship goes down
On the dark and the rolling sea"

And though she put her mind to it
Her heart was never in it
She stayed around just long enough to get paid
She won't pass the time with you
She can't stay a minute
And all these changing faces never bothered her at all
That just existed like a back-drop
Or a pattern on the wall
Lucy looks like someone who is waiting for a call
She knows will come
But no-one else can hear at all
Lucy finds the dressing room and the bar
Hangs her clothes up
Hopes tonight the contract won't be broken
Well, they kick you round so much when you're not a star
Make you play all night just for a pittance or a token
But all these imperfections never bothered her at all
She says it sharpens your perception
When your back's against the wall
There's something that enables her to rise above it all
To shrug it off, just when it seems to go too far
I think you almost
Feel the pain coming on inside
I think you almost
Feel it now and you don't know why
You don't know why
The last time that I saw her
She had given up the chase
Moved away to California
Got a suntan on her face
She says that life was just another time, another space
It's over now, she learned a lot
It's not a wasteI think you almost

I don't think she's ready to listen
I don't think she wants to come back

2051,the-year-of-the-cat,2006,al-stewart,Rock,"On a morning from a Bogart movie
In a country where they turn back time
You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre
Contemplating a crime
She comes out of the sun in a silk dress running
Like a watercolor in the rain
Don't bother asking for explanations
She'll just tell you that she came
In the year of the cat
She doesn't give you time for questions
As she locks up your arm in hers
And you follow 'till your sense of which direction
Completely disappears
By the blue tiled walls near the market stalls
There's a hidden door she leads you to
These days, she says, I feel my life
Just like a river running through
The year of the cat
While she looks at you so cooly
And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea
She comes in incense and patchouli
So you take her, to find what's waiting inside
The year of the cat
Well morning comes and you're still with her
And the bus and the tourists are gone
And you've thrown away your choice you've lost your ticket
So you have to stay on
But the drum-beat strains of the night remain
In the rhythm of the new-born day
You know sometime you're bound to leave her
But for now you're going to stay
In the year of the cat"

The frost upon your face
I was haunted by your beauty
And it drew me to this place
I felt the chill of mystery
With one foot on your shore
And then and there resolved to go
Where no man had before
CHORUS
Maybe I was snowblind
But it seemed the wind spoke true
And I believed its stories then
As dreamers sometimes do
In Antarctica
In Antarctica
Who knows what the powers may be

Mindless of the dangers
Out across the virgin snow
Seduced by this ambition
I easily forget
The hopeless quest of Shackleton
The dreamlike death of Scott

2054,roads-to-moscow,2006,al-stewart,Rock,"They crossed over the border the hour before dawn
Moving in lines through the day
Most of our planes were destroyed on the ground where they lay
Waiting for orders we held in the wood - word from the front never came
By evening the sound of the gunfire was miles away
Ah, softly we move through the shadows, slip away through the trees
Crossing their lines in the mists in the fields on our hands and our knees
And all that I ever was able to see
The fire in the air glowing red silhouetting the smoke on the breeze
All summer they drove us back through the Ukraine
Smolyensk and Viyasma soon fell
By autumn we stood with our backs to the town of Orel
Closer and closer to Moscow they come - riding the wind like a bell
General Guderian stands at the crest of the hill
Winter brought with her the rains, oceans of mud filled the roads
Gluing the tracks of their tanks to the ground while the sky filled with snow
And all that I ever was able to see
The fire in the air glowing red silhouetting the snow on the breeze
In the footsteps of Napoleon the shadow figures stagger through the winter
Falling back before the gates of Moscow,
Standing in the wings like an avenger
And far away behind their lines the partisans are stirring in the forest
Coming unexpectedly upon their outposts, growing like a promise
You'll never know, you'll never know
Which way to turn, which way to look, you'll never see us
As we're stealing through the blackness of the night
You'll never know, you'll never hear us
And the evening sings in a voice of amber, the dawn is surely coming
The morning road leads to Stalingrad, and the sky is softly humming
Two broken Tigers on fire in the night flicker their souls to the wind
We wait in the lines for the final approach to begin
It's been almost four years that I've carried a gun
At home it'll almost be spring
The flames of the Tigers are lighting the road to Berlin
Ah, quickly we move through the ruins that bow to the ground
The old men and children they send out to face us, they can't slow us down
And all that I ever was able to see
The eyes of the city are opening now it's the end of the dream
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Now you can taste it in the wind, the war is over
And I listen to the clicking of the train wheels as we roll across the border
And now they ask me of the time
That I was caught behind their lines and taken prisoner
""They only held me for a day, a lucky break"", I say;
They turn and listen closer
I'll never know, I'll never know
Why I was taken from the line and all the others
To board a special train and journey deep into the heart of holy Russia
And it's cold and damp in the transit camp, and the air is still and sullen
And the pale sun of October whispers the snow will soon be coming
And I wonder when I'll be home again and the morning answers
""Never""
And the evening sighs and the steely Russian skies go on forever"

Blew all around

Sailors made their peace then with the Almighty
Still I kept hope in my heart
Through the salt and stormy night
Every hour the wind struck ever harder
We held on tight in the dark
As our bow rose and fell
Till we came with daylight into the harbor
Hard by the monastery walls
To the ringing of a bell
Peter on the White Sea
A day to recall when days are done
Peter on the White Sea

That I'm sick of the touch and there's only so much you can take.

she was just looking around for a way
In the pit of the night there was nowhere to hide any more
She was out on a limb, she was reaching for things

And she had to be sure that she wouldn't get caught like before.

Stare at the overcast sky
And put you away in a drawer in my mind
And Ill just bid all of my troubles goodbye
The country round here is deserted; theres no one at all
People come here in the summer and leave in the fall
You followed after them, disappeared into the night
Now all thats left is the footprint you made
In the mud, frozen in white
Ill sit on my porch like William McKinley
And Ill let the world come to me
And if its too busy, I really dont mind and
Theres no place Ill want to be
Now and again, I will open and window and
Stare at the overcast sky
And put you away in a drawer in my mind
And Ill just bid all of my troubles goodbye

2092,pretty-golden-hair,2008,al-stewart,Rock,"Born in England's pleasant green
Like a picture postcard scene
To childhood spread with fond maternal care
From the day that he was born
Proud relations came to fawn
And compliment his pretty golden hair
In boyhood sent away
To a boarding school to stay
Its crumbling proud traditions forced to bear
And his friends in this new world
Said he looks more like a girl
With those blue eyes and pretty golden hair
Fades secluded youth
Into manhood's search for truth
His mother's eyes now wet had turned to stare
For he said I must be bound
This day for London town
For I believe my fortune's waiting there
So like an eager cutting knife
He plunged in a new life
Oh never known beforehand anywhere
And the thought that he might trip
In his ignorance and slip
Never struck beneath his pretty golden hair
Ah the days soon grew thin
And boredom fast set in
His job was thrown away without a care
For a man who softly said
You'll earn twice as much instead
With those blue eyes and pretty golden hair
Well London town possessed
Of many a tempter's nest
And thus he fell with scarce another care
As so easily he slipped
Into prostitution's grip
Foundationed by his pretty golden hair
Ah but the years quickly flew
And his mind slowly grew
From early freedom into deep despair
As the money ceased to roll
A tired and lonely soul
Poured curses on his pretty golden hair
Ah the years stole their time
Now the living's hard to find
And early friends have vanished in the air
And the gay parties's ease
Changed to public lavatories
Have turned to grey his pretty golden hair
Oh his life was only used
And his body just abused
By those who never think and never care
But though his file said suicide
No, that wasn't why he died
It was murder by his pretty golden hair"
2093,shah-of-shahs,2008,al-stewart,Rock,"After these processions comes the sweeping up
The rag and bone possessions, an old tin cup
The army trucks have hauled away the newly slain
The angry crowd retreats, but theyll be back again
And the prisoner in the palace does not understand
The ingratitude around him after all hes done and planned
But if this the way that it must be then hell be damned
If he will let them take away his perfect dream
Ministers stuff bank notes into leather bags
Their wives have packed the jewelry and the luggage tanks
The word is on the street now, growing day by day
And even the informers know the stay away
And the prisoner in the palace is appalled by this charade
Feeling strangely unprotected by his miles of golden braid
And if this is the way that it must be then Im afraid
He will not let them take away his perfect dream
And these mountains of equipment brought from foreign lands
Are now stacked up in the desert being buried by the sand
These rows of helicopters rusting where they stand
Are butterflies to take away the perfect dream
He cried inside the limousine and at the airport too
Where the soldier knelt before him and kissed his shoe
He flew across the desert and the open sea
While they tore down all his statues and his legacy
And the victor greets the newsmen with a strange and stoic style
They take a hundred thousand pictures and in none of them a smile
But this is just the way that it must be now for a while
Hes only come to bring another perfect dream"

On a back country lane
I came on the village
Where first I grew
And stopped to climb up
The hill once again
Looking down from the tracks
To the grey slate roofs
I watched the village moving
As the day went slowly by
In the field we lay here
Lovers' footsteps went by
In the fields we lay here
My very first love and I
Under timeless arcadian skies
Under timeless arcadian skies
The old canal lies
Sleeping under the sky
The barges are gone to a lost decade
On overgrown banks here
Lovers' footsteps went by
Long before ever the roads were made
And in our turn we passed here
And carved our names on trees
As the days washed by like
Waves of an endless sea
Under timeless arcadian skies
Under timeless arcadian skies
Time runs through your fingers
You never hold till its gone
Some fragments just linger with you
Like snow in the spring hanging on"

And back in some forgotten time we shared the cold north days

So it's goodbye to my lady of the islands
On Remembrance Day the bands all played, the bells pealed through the park
And you lay there by the Do Not signs, and shamed them with your spark
Now winter moans in old men's bones as the day falls into dark
So it's goodbye to my lady of the islands
It was just like this behind the kisses you so soon swept away
I always knew that some day yo'd be bound to just get pulled away
The summer sun beats on and on, the shops swim in the heat
And you're standing by the traffic signs with taxis at your feet
I know that in your city skin you're feeling more complete
So it's goodbye to my lady of the islands"
2096,year-of-the-cat,2008,al-stewart,Rock,"On a morning from a Bogart movie
In a country where they turn back time
You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre
Contemplating a crime
She comes out of the sun in a silk dress running
Like a watercolor in the rain
Don't bother asking for explanations
She'll just tell you that she came
In the year of the cat
She doesn't give you time for questions
As she locks up your arm in hers
And you follow 'till your sense of which direction
Completely disappears
By the blue tiled walls near the market stalls
There's a hidden door she leads you to
These days, she says, I feel my life
Just like a river running through
The year of the cat
While she looks at you so cooly
And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea
She comes in incense and patchouli
So you take her, to find what's waiting inside
The year of the cat
Well morning comes and you're still with her
And the bus and the tourists are gone
And you've thrown away your choice you've lost your ticket
So you have to stay on
But the drum-beat strains of the night remain
In the rhythm of the new-born day
You know sometime you're bound to leave her
But for now you're going to stay
In the year of the cat"

Only to find there was no reprieve
Would you still be a man for all seasons?
Or would you just have to leave
We measure our days out
In steps of uncertainty
Not turning to see how we've come
And peer down the highway
From here to eternity
And reach out for love on the run
While the man for all seasons
Is lost behind the sun
Henry Plantagenet still looks for someone
To bring good news in his hour of doubt
While Thomas More waits in the Tower of London
Watching the sands running out
And measures the hours out
From here to oblivion
In actions that can't be undone
A sailor through the darkness
He scans the meridian
And caught by the first rays of dawn
The man for all seasons
Is lost beneath the storm
And I should know by now
I should know by now
I hear them call it out all around
Oh, they go
There's nothing to believe in
Hear them,
Just daydreams, deceiving
They'll just let you down
What if you reached the age of reason
Only to find there was no reprieve
Would you still be a man for all seasons?
Or would you just disbelieve?
We measure our gains out in luck and coincidence
Lanterns to turn back the night
And put our defeats down to chance or experience
And try once again for the light
Some wait for the waters of fortune to cover them
Some just see the tides of ill chance running over them
Some call on Jehovah
Some cry out to Allah
Some wait for the boats that still row to Valhalla
Well, you should try to accept what the fates are unfolding
While some say they're sure where the blame should be falling
You look round for maybe a chance of forestalling
Bot too soon its over and done
And the man for all seasons
Is lost behind the sun"

And puts the paper on the table

To the fleets of steel and the waves of grey
Look away, look away, look away

The Queen is old but she lingers still
Like the fading ring of a distant bell
And Oscar Wilde in his prison cell
Laments a brighter day
And in some window a red flag flies
In a meeting room
You will know changes soon

Strangest women run wild down there,

They fight like demons,

shadows on your windowsill.
Like sparks of light in the shifting skies,
our ancient ships go sailing still on

I'll seek Poseidon's daughter.
Oarsmen pull and curse and sweat

At night I hear their stories told,

He hears the voices of salvation through the static
Just turns the volume down
A chain link fence round a boarded up arcade
Towers of glass that petroleum has made
But he wouldn't have been born
At any other moment in the world
And in the morning he will hear the silver kettle
Calling him out of his sleep
The world outside goes by in plastic and in metal
He's got his secrets to keep
The daily news forms a pattern on TV
Violence first, then a cat stuck up a tree
But he wouldn't have been born
At any other moment in this world
One o'clock and the office empties out
He watches as they pass
Nostalgic for something intangible
A time that never was
There is a crack along the plaster in the kitchen
It forms the shape of her face
Just for a moment he will trace it with his finger
One day he'll paint her away
He sees her now - she's got a clean white shirt on
She's someone he'd just love to get the dirt on
And she couldn't have been born
At any other moment in the world"

So I leave the chapel gloom
To find the shelter of my tiny room
But it's alright while the lights of the city shine so bright
It's all right till the last winding train fades from sight
Then alone in my room I must stay to lose or win
While these wild bedsitter images come back to hem me in
The panelled patterns on the door
Chase shivering shadows to the floor
Upon the pillow worn and thin
The memories of hopes begin
The carpet with its flowers and shredding
Spires a foot before my bed
The crack that won't return again
Advancing through my broken window pane
But it's alright while the lights of the city shine so bright
It's all right till the last winding train fades from sight
Then alone in my room I must stay to lose or win
While these wild bedsitter images come back to hem me in
The friends I've left back home all write
With laughing words that warm my sight
Saying, Tell us, how's the city life
I reply and say just fine
(Oh, you must be something)
And so you see I can't go back
Until I either win or crack
I'm standing in a one way street
The stage is set

A finger that juts out into the foam

A few expeditions that pass now and then
They'll be back someday

But I woke with the frost, and noticed she'd lost
The veil that covered her eyes
I said oh, you can leave it."
2118,in-brooklyn,2008,al-stewart,Rock,"Oh I come from Pittsburgh to study astrology
She said as she stepped on my instep
I could show you New York with a walk between Fourth Street and Nine
Then out of her coat taking seven harmonicas
She sat down to play on a doorstep
Saying, Come back to my place I will show you the stars and the signs
So I followed her into the black lands
Where the window frames peel and flake
And the old Jewish face behind the lace
Even now trying to get to see what's cooking
Just John the Baptist in the park getting laid thinking there's no-one looking
And its eighty degrees and I'm down on my knees in Brooklyn
Her house was a dusty collection of rusty
Confusion with landings and tunnels
And leaning bookcases and spaces and faces and things
Where twenty-five Puerto Ricans, Manhattan Mohicans
And Jewish-Italian Pawnbrokers
Lead their theatrical lives in their rooms in the wings
While outside in the black lands
The violent day runs wild
And the black and white minstrels run through the crazy
Alleys while the cops go booking
And ruthless toothless agents sneak around and there's no-one looking
And it's eighty degrees and I'm down on my knees in Brooklyn
And oh, I'm back in the city again
You can tell by the smell of the hamburger stand in the rain
She spoke of astrology while muttering apologies
For coffee that tasted of hot dogs
I said, That's OK, mine was cold anyway, and just grand
Then she lay on the bed while the radio fed
Us with records and adverts for cat food
And I looked at her, holding my thoughts in the palm of my hand
And outside in the black lands
The evening came and went
And the bums in the street begging money for one last drink
Are hanging round the liquor stores trying to get a foot in
And the girl from Pittsburgh and I made love on a mattress with the new moon looking
And in the cool evening breeze I was down on my knees in Brooklyn"

From the walls of the Bastille
And through the streets of Paris
Runs a sense of the unreal
The Kings have all departed
There servants are nowhere
We burned out their mansions
In the name of Robespierre
And still we wait
To see the day begin
Our time is wasting in the wind
Wondering why
Wondering why, it echoes
Through the lonely palace of Versailles
Inside the midnight councils
The lamps are burning low
On you sit and talk all through the night
But there's just no place to go
And Bonaparte is coming
With his army from the south
Marat your days are numbered
And we live hand to mouth
While we wait
To see the day begin
Our time is wasting in the wind
Wondering why
Wondering why, it echoes
Through the lonely palace of Versailles
The ghost of revolution
Still prowls the Paris streets
Down all the restless centuries
It wonders incomplete
It speaks inside the cheap red wine
Of cafe summer nights
Its red and amber voices
Call the cars at traffic lights
Why do you wait
To see the day begin
Your time is wasting in the wind
Wondering why
Wondering why, it echoes
Through the lonely palace of Versailles
Wondering why, it echoes

Carried along by their call
Seeking for a way to enlighten
Searching for the sense of it all
Like a kiss on the wind I was thrown to the stars
Captured and ordered in the army of Mars
Marching to the sound of the drum in my head
I followed the call
Only to be Malachi Constant
I thought I came to this earth
Living in the heart of the moment
With the riches I gained at my birth
But here in the yellow and blue of my days
I wander the endless Mercurian caves
Watching for the signs the Harmonians make
The words on the walls
I was drawn by the sirens of Titan
And so I came in the end
Under the shadow of Saturn
With statues and birds for my friends
Finding a home at the end of my days
Looking around I've only to say
I was the victim of a series of accidents
As are we allI was drawn by the sirens of Titan (as are we all)
As are we all

The shadows set, the night grew still
And as I sat, guitar on knee
A voice of flowers called to me
Sing, sing to me your song
Sing, for I belong to the night
In the grey morning light
I'll be gone
I turned with eyes that strained for sight
And there amid the failing light
Dimly saw a figure small
Heard a voice of magic call
Sing, sing to me your song
Sing, for I belong to the night
In the grey morning light
I'll be gone
My fumbling fingers found the chords
My trembling lips fought for the words
I stopped to ask the stranger how
He softly said, no questions now
But sing, sing to me your song
Sing, for I belong to the night
In the grey morning light
I'll be gone
Then with the magic of the elves
My fingers danced among themselves
A heart with lightness thus endowed
Formed melodies I know not how
Song, played the whole night long
Thus he danced and clapped through the night
And with grey morning light
He was gone
Now whispering wind plays o'er the hill
And the evening sounds again grow still
A year or more has passed since then
Oh, he will not pass my way again
And so I sing, sing to you my song
Sing, for I belong to the night
In the grey morning light
I'll be gone
So I sing, sing to you my song
Sing, for I belong to the night
In the grey morning light
I'll be gone"

He is greeted like a prince
Society declares him wise and funny
Celebrities are only decorations in this place

His temporary lover has amber coloured skin
In a lush apartment in the city center
Bankers like his company
They always let him in
There is no door to tell him do not enter
They're following a dream
Following a dream
Sleepwalking
A boy has become a member of a most desired club
He has a fine address in these sixties
If hipness could be diagrammed he would be the hub
Girls follow him round like sexy pixies
There's talk among the money men in Miami beach
The train is leaving
You don't want to miss it
Whatever it is he's offering it's there within your reach
So here is the ring
Why don't you kiss it
They're following a dream
Following a dream
Sleepwalking
But there's a country house a world away from here
Where accusations fill the room today
Something has gone missing and it's absolutely clear
A servent left quite suddenly
He didn't ask for money
He just packed up and left quietly away
Back inside the nouveau world
The rich are sitting down
They realize it's time for some assessments
Their charasmatic friend is somehow no where to be found
Along with beggered will and their investments
Someone said they saw him on a plane to Salvador or Moscow
Now the weather's warming
The lure of easy money keeps him constantly employed
It's a social service he's performing
Following a dream
Following a dream

In a bookshop in Charing Cross Road
I first set eyes on a girl and at once I did know
She had eyes like a poet and hair like a rainbow
Reflecting the lights that did glow
And the sadness she kept in her eyes
Struck my senses a blow
And so as by chance at the touch of a glance
We could find ourselves out in the road
With no crush of time to defeat us and no place to go
And I couldn't say how but the coffee bar crowd
Had appeared through the silence that broke
And she said, Oh my father's a judge in St Albans you know
Oh well, then perhaps I could help you
You know that St. Albans is miles away
And I've got a room in Swiss Cottage in which you could stay
She laughed, Oh I couldn't do that, for I've got
To be up in the morning you see
So I rang up to find out the first morning train she could take
And so in the gloom of a candlelit room
With spaghetti, two forks and a plate
She said, Oh I really would like to be free and escape
Oh well if it's like that
You don't have to go back
And you're perfectly welcome to stay
But I've not finished school yet
She said as she got into bed
And so as she slept and the pure morning crept
Through the windows to take her away
I thought you can't make people be what you want them to be
I could see my self nailed to a dormitory tale
Of a holiday night's escapade
And just yesterday she had seemed like a woman to me"

Expecting rejection but finding instead
A certain connection that left you surprised
And then gave you electrical thoughts in your head
Emboldened by this you were tempted a kiss
On the brow of a mystery passing you by
And thus we're afforded a simple reward
In the shape of a chord from a street corner choir
Through her window you can see her
With her solitary air
You felt a certain twinge inside you
From her military hair
And you'd have normally acted quite formally
This was the moment to open the door
You instantly mated and constantly dated
Though your mother hated the clothes that she wore

I mean it's natural for a person to hold on to it most
That is their privacy and I can see you're feeling like that

I refuse, I refuse to follow your path, refuse to live my life by the lies you've masked
Refuse to give into the words you asked, fuck the words you've written
You won't break my down
Not with the back of your hand, I found the strength
To break, these chains
You know I wont be caged, I'll bite the hand that beats
You, you were my hope, you held my dreams
You make the innocent believe,
You were the greed, you told the lies
How do you sleep at night?
I'll stay away, keeping myself safe
I'll dance the night away, as you stand there out of place
I was told, show no trust in you, you'll only make me pay
If only I had knew, you'd tear away
The hope, the dreams, you make the innocent believe
The greed, the lies, how do you fucking sleep at night?
The shame, the hate, apologies you've left to late
You try to take this crown, fuck off
You won't break me, you won't break me
You, you were my hope, you held my dreams
You make the innocent believe,
You were the greed, you told the lies
How do you sleep at night?
I'll stay away, keeping myself safe
I'll dance the night away
As you stand there out of place
Take a look at me now"

I can't help, but to see, this assistance living shit outta me,
I could lose who I am!
Every time I walk away,
Every word I never say!
Restless, chasing shadows
Choices, facing gallows' pole.
Are you hanging by a thread,
Or swinging from the rope?
Don't think we don't see your scars,
Are you afraid of who you are?
Are you afraid of who you are?!
Denial, my soul will burn,
Is it burn-, burn-, burn-, burn-, burning me out?
You're feeding the flames!
Spread out the ash,
Pretend to see,
That you can still fight some day with me.
I just feed the flames.
Every time I walk away,
Every word I'd ever say!
Restless, chasing shadows,
Choices, facing gallows' pole.
Are you hanging by a thread,
Or swinging from the rope?
Don't think we don't see your scars,
Are you afraid of who you are?
Oh my god, what am I afraid of?
This success scares the living shit out of me.
Oh my god, are you afraid of me,
And everything that breathes?
Restless, chasing shadows,
Choices, facing gallows' pole.
Are you hanging by a thread,
Or swinging from the rope?
Don't think we don't see your scars,
Are you afraid of who you are?
Afraid of who you are?"

Before it gets to late
And there's no turning back

One by one we fit and then we fall

So lonely
Fragile and unloved
Lost inside ourselves
And blindly staring at the sun
So lonely
Is this what we've become?
Line them up they fall
Something to live for
Not sure who's coming next
But never looking back
I want something more
Something to live for
Before it gets to late
And there's no turning back.

Give 'til there's nothing left,
Value in every breath,

Suddenly anger cripples
Colors red everything around me
Sometimes we hurt the ones that we love
And it kills me inside!

The cost is over baring
The price I pay could dreamed of
And it kills me inside!

And the skies begin to fall, I'll wait for you
When the days grow old and long
And my skin turns into stone, I'll wait for you
When the pain it seems too much
And my heart starts beating out of touch
I don't need a thing, I'll wait for you
It's all so different now, emotions burn me out
I have a lifeless touch, this distance leaves no doubt
I fear it all too much but part of me believes
As the years pass away you made me recognize

Scared and hiding
Blind without you

Be we bare our teeth
Strength and pain of what rules the world

Deny any wrong doing
Pass the buck and then fake some more blame
Life's a circle then we all reap the whirlwind
Then we push for war

There's enough light in your eyes to light up our little world

Kill me slowly, I'll never be the same

And I dedicare to you all that I have
And I promise you that I will stand right by your side

Better yet go with crushed velvet, that way I'll be damn sure to enjoy eternity
My daily life writes the eulogy, engraved on tombstone diaries
laid to rest with the passing of time
Seems to me that even love can die
And the rituals, that fade away, and the roses that cease to be laid
And to me it clearly appears that we're already one foot in a very shallow grave

Take away the pain of being me
Soothe my soul caress my heart
And end my fear of my bad memories
Eradicated

Were stronger than the rest, unstoppable

I would shut up, if I thought that it mattered.
That's what it feels like,
When you're stitched into this skin.
I feel stuck, and no one thinks something's missing.
(something's missing)
No one cares, no one listens,
Screaming words that you fake hearin'.
No one cares, no one listens anymore
(no one listens anymore)
My eyes burn as I bury how I'm feelin'
Close my eyes it's my life that I've been stealing
If it's so right, why do I feel a sense of longing
I had it all, and yet I thought that something's missin'
Something's missing
No one cares, no one listens
Screaming words that you fake hearin'
No one cares
No one listens anymore
[chorus x2]
So paranoid I've been hiding from the sun
I'm tired of being afraid of everything and everyone
I'm so tired
No one cares, no one listens
Screaming words that you fake hearin'
No one cares
No one listens anymore

2218,untitled-finale,2007,atreyu,Rock,"[Chorus]
You put a bullet in my head
Turned black thoughts to red
This could all end in tragedy
I dream of you dead laid you dead to rest
I won't look back in for memory
But don't rush us out like I sold you
Are you a killer and I think I know its you
I was deep in that night I know its taking this
So hurry up to figure you out to insult'
Your glass kept from falling down
One time from your good times
I'm not interested in working this out
[Chorus]
And that's what you are
I said blasterd fucking mess
Fuck off to be without you
Die in use to burn just bury
Any part because the walk on my hand
Not even not even kick you when your down
Though you wanted something because you
Are living the lonely star
But this is the part where I say goodbye!
(And let the scent of time)
Pull over us say goodbye!
And let the sands of time flow over us
You never had to crawl
You never had to say what it feels like
To be so trapped underneath
The weight of someone's world comes crashing down on me
I was longing to be free i've left a burden in you and me
This is my farewell to you and I
This will all end in tragedy
This will all end in tragedy
This will all end in tragedy
This will all end in tragedy
(Oh this will all end in tragedy)

Grab the bull by the horns the old addage goes.
Nobody tells you where to go from there.
I see whats grateful in you.
Decisions have to be made.
The the best half is the hardest earned.

Trying to keep a level head.
In the most unsettling of times.
Today I'll become the bull.
There is so much to stake.
I'll stumble I'll loose my place.
Crowded in while surrounded by sin.
Destiny takes its hold.
Fight it or let it go.
But I choose how the day will end.

I lose myself inside myself.

Were stronger than the rest, unstoppable

Something black burning it's way out of me.
Searing the flesh,
Pain is the only thing I feel,
Scars all I see.
Oh no the fire's burning my insides again,
What can I do to silence my desire tonight?
Face consumer reason leaving all the ashes there,
You won't catch me for granting my decision,
I can't keep telling myself what I want to hear,
I can't just close my eyes.
I know that it's killing me,
And it's poisoning the best of me,
But I say, I don't want to believe.
So let me tell you boy, tell you boy,
About the lies I lead.
That is how it kills, I got some flames and gasoline
Broken teeth replace the blackout memories in my head
Wreckage from the blast, it often shakes me to the floor
(to the floor)
I know it's over but I can't go home tonight.
And after this I feel as empty as the night before,
Feel the pain and yet I'm still begging for more.
Masochistic, nihilistic, gurging wrecked up thoughts
My life's a mess and I can't find a way to fix it.
I can't keep telling myself what I want to hear,
I can't just close my eyes
(my eyes, my eyes, my fucking eyes)
I know that it's killing me,
And it's poisoning the best of me,
But I say, I don't want to believe.
So let me tell you boy, tell you boy,
About the lies I lead.
Calling, calling out.
The darkness reaches up my soul,
I'm riddled with self-doubt.
Crawling, crawling out,
My will to fight will more than suffice,
While others will lay down.
It's only as dark as you make it.

And it's poisoning the best of me,

But that's the way that it goes

The last angel has gone
I can't remember the last time I cried
The last angel has gone home
The memories stacking up
And they pull at my guts
What do I have to do to end it
The better days hacked away
Leaving me only pain
This regret is never ending
But in the blink of an eye
This life passes you by
I wish that I could give you my time

I have watched you retrogress
I have seen what you've become liar
Take your eyes off of me
Its funny how fast blue eyes fade gray liar
Let me be captivated By your beauty
Then let me fall from your grace
Unto my broken knees
Close My eyes so tightly
The tears are welling up
You aren't worth the waste
Of the salt or the water
And you are deceit
Watching the sun play in your hair
I couldn't really care, care any less about you
Just wither away real beauty is forever"

Now there is no beauty in bleeding mascara.
Her lips are quivering like a withering rose,
She's back again.

It's much more than words and feelings
Sucking me dry.

Broken hearts and misspent hopes.

Or will you crawl into
A casket
An early tomb
Lay down and give up inside
She'd rather die
When you fall
So spent from emotion
She is what
Brings you to your feet
Where challenges lie
On the verge of destruction
She pulls you back
And she gives you wings

Can you feel her
running through your veins
She will always live forever

Make-up smeared in her eyes

It shattered when it fell and I broke to pieces

Judgment will come for the wicked, then we will see who burns
Raise your heads, unclasp your hands,
Your weakness makes me tremble
True strength comes from within

Not exist under standards, set by some bullshit rule book
What prayers of yours, were ever answered, by degrading others
Spare me your biblical back peddling nonsense
For the people that you've hurt, and the being your dishonor,
Your fall from grace, will finally justify my means

Break through the shame and the silence
After so much has been taken away
The evil in you should be fully repaid

Wasted in solitude

In the fires of hell
May be your torment
Redefine and amplify your constant suffering

Cut out your heart

To face the morning light
So Pathologically
Trapped in a system that breaks originality
In favor of bland safe marketability
Middle of a long day
Turns into working long weeks
What are we doing this for
Whose fucking stocks will increase
At times we're all just little junkies and whores
Clawing scratching unattainable dreams

I say smash it fucking all

Working doubles to survive, to get by
A passionless job in a meaningless lie

Infer this
Clear to any rapper that is wacka
I'll slap ya
I talk shit that's amazin'

Now I will stomp some sense
Into those numbskulls
I leave 'em dumb-dull

If y'all was girls
I'd be kissin' ya
And the brothers get phat pounds
And goin' round is phat pounds of indo

Imitations getting penetrated and reassimulated
In my emcee training class remain in mass
Never get liquidated convert energy
Into matter instantly with a pen and pad
Calculate the cenograd, heat the center of gravity
Abolish apathy graphically packing 380's
With body heat sensitive bullets you need safety

With spare raps to tear back their mass

Professor test the pitiful
Micronautalyst interchangeable
All of this gamma grammar far from Bama
Got mind control bandannas
To control your clan with scanners
Brand the planet like a band of bandits
Who man the cannons and guns with random
Sub atomic, love of logic, bug with phonics
Tub of chronic low in bridle with controlling ciphers
Unraveling rhyme, in traveling time
Alien life form mail in a pipe bomb

I was plannin' to persue another quest for the bus
I had to go to San Fran, it's something that I can't stand
It's beggin' for a ride with ma dukes makes a fuss
I don't like fussin' so I ask my older cousin
Could he maybe find time to give the D-E-L a lift
He said it is impossible because he has a roster full of plans for the
day
I had to go and sift through pennies in my jeans
To many it may seem that the public transportation really isn't keen
And I agree with the theory
Because it's 3:30 and the bus was due at 2:35
I wear my Girbauds so I can wait with pride
I waited at the bus stop feeling kinda high
From a spliff that I smoked
I riffed and provoked
A liitle scene when the bus arrived late like a joke
With a corny punchline
And it was only lunchtime
The bus should've been here, the driver had much time
To get is act together
No matter what the weather
Now I'm sittin' at the bus stop waitin' like forever
[SKIT #1]
When oh when is the bus gonna come
I'm getting sick and tired of the wait
When oh when is the bus gonna come
Well here comes a pack of about 14
Lookin' real mean with hoodies and jeans
And bad attitudes and I wasn't in the mood
For no head on collision with the hoods
Try to use my transfer but it's no good
Would these rough lookin' kids get busy with the youngsta
Amongst the many who must catch rapid transit to get through the city
I'm not certain
But if I go sit in the back it's curtains
Kids wanna ride the back
What kinda shit is that?
Nowadays niggas can't wait to hit the back
Let me stand in the front with the elderly
So those other cats won't raise hell with me

I should've caught the 46B

And shoots the breeze with the ladies

A kid sits by me with a gang of afro sheen on
I'm not Joe Clark and I would hate for him to lean on
My shoulder and try to hold a conversation
'Cause I don't have the patience
When oh when is the bus gonna reach its destination
Question over space and time
Wastin' time
Word up, I can't take this line of nitwits
I'm about to have a fit quick
'Cause this trip here is making me car sick
Check out the brother with the loaded .38
Braggin' to his buddies about the money that he makes
Sellin' crack viles like pancakes
To baseheads just like the one
That's sittin by the window starvin' for a fix
He spent his last 80 cents on fare
He raises up and lets me get in his chair
Then I sit and take a snooze

I seek souls like mines
so my mind finds inner peace
and then a beast
could never devour
my powers arrive
from survivors of this holocaust.
Please be hopeful,
never thinkin' all is lost
in my sector,
specter
slidin',
collidin' with my lifestyle
so I fight while they threaten me,
sweatin' me -
well I'm quite mild,
the world makes me gnarly,
but an introvert not hardly.
I deal with it.
I feel a bit
under the weather,
I need to pull my pieces back together.
Fallin' apart, stallin' a heart of sincerity
since there will be another stoplight
and its not right
so I might go insane of this brain
of mine
maintain a line that has been tame
before the tempest.
I'm looking to my better interests.
I never tried to post or tried to impress
anyone
so why do I got to suffer
every single day it seems the way of the world is rougher.
And then you wonder why I love to hallucinate,
because I never ever thought I would get used to hate.
So I imbedded my time within my mind,
and rhymin'
was the only way I kept from bein' confined
to quarters,
sure there's good times and bad,
but the bad time's are overwhelming,
and how the hell things
get out of hand I ask you,
you have to give an answer;
eating at my brain like it was cancer.
Worryin'.
Hurryin',
My thought processes.
I got offices
imbedded in my skull,
a million secretaries actin' scary
when they type 200 words per minute.
It just occurred to me I'm in it.
'Cause I'm the boss,
the head honcho,
at least to this mutiny.
The whole idea is cute to me.
so I entertain it
and let my brain get
deeper and deeper
until it vibrates like a beeper
and I can't maintain it.
So what's the verdict?
It's D.E.L. the visionary and I come with the absurd shit.
[Break with freaky ""call the operator"" sample]
If I had not one friend I would be gooooone.
Way in outer space singin' one sooooong:
'Zippety doo dah, zippety day,
my oh my what a wonderful day
when my mind's dusted'.
Thrusted
out beyond the stars, I'm the satellite.
Transmittin, fit in situations that'll rattle tikes -
scare 'em,
dare 'em to go farther.
So then I go father,
burnin' my brain out with mental lava.
Scalding,
all things
rearrange so I never socialize,
when you feel my eyes.
The dilated pupils,
I violated scruples,
'cause I told myself I'd never do it again,
but now I grin.
Laugh on the inside,
men tried to strap me
in a straight jacket
when I laugh and I'm happy
for two hours straight,
these powers hate me
and they make me wanna cower,
but lately I've been feeling like a tower.
Tall and sturdy,
wordy, though I never say a word,
'cause when I say a word,
before it's like they never heard.
Nothing ever changes except within my cerebellum,
so I'll never tell 'em,
never tell 'em,
never tell 'em.
I'll tell it to my soul over and over
even though I'm locked within a room with padded walls,
I'm never sober.
Inspections,
injections,
keep me confined
to my inner thoughts
and this is how I lost my mind.

2302,del-s-nightmare,2007,del-the-funky-homosapien,Hip-Hop,"Let me tell you a little story about the slave master
Use a whip on your ass so you behave faster
You got chains on your neck and the man's respect
You'll work all damn day but you will never see a check in the field
Cotton you yield, your skin peels off your back
From the crack of the whip, it won't heal
Ya wish, you had a shield 'cause he wields iron
So when you act up, he smokes ya and keeps firing and it's tiring
Forget about recreation
One wrong move and it's death you're facing
White mothafuckaz got the ball and chain
On your leg and in the form of religion on your brain
They say, you the devil, you say, who the devil?
Some of us was house niggers, some of us was rebels
Some tried to get along the best they could
And didn't nobody use the phrase, it's all good, would you?
They got you living like a shrew
They throw you pig lips and chicken gizzards then you make a stew
They give us a white Jesus to appease us
We talk among ourselves and hope nobody sees us
They had our brothers beating us, called us creations
Plus monkeys, they just junkies mistreating us
The master said, ""If you don't whip 'em, you're dead""
It was fucking with his head but he beat us instead and we bled
Red blood flowing like a flood
Then he'd rape your mother stick her face in the mud
They were ruthless! If you tried to front, you'd be toothless
Some tried to run even though it seemed useless
Virginity was torn, soon babies was born
That was half white and now his skin is kind of light
You think you're special, because they let you oversee the carnage?
But I bet you will get hung, even if you stick out your tongue
'Cause they pull out the shank and stick it right through your lung
Now it's 96 and white people say, forget it, it's all in the past
And some even regret it 'cause they think we'll set it
Now my missions to get federal
So I can raise a black family with a true devil
And you know how that goes
The slave master watching over you
Always trying to tell you what the fuck to do
The slave master watching over you
But ain't nothing gonna stop me and my crew
The slave master watching over you
Always trying to tell you what the fuck to do
The slave master watching over you
But ain't nothing gonna stop me and my crew
This is for you kids trying to get signed
Just a little something you should keep in mind
The labels are slave masters, artists are slaves
Don't get too raunchy, they want you to behave
You get signed, you're thinking this is great
But wait you never knew what was at stake
Creative control they withhold, you sell your soul
When you sign on the dotted line hoping to go gold
But you'll never see that, not without promotion
The label'll just throw your shit out and got it floatin'
You think your shit is potent but ain't nobody buying it
If they ain't never heard of it, ain't nobody trying it
If they ain't never heard of it, your record' they murder it
You can complain but they are not concerned a bit
'Cause when they signed you, they thought you'd make a hit
'Cause of who you were affiliated with and all that bullshit
Frustrations, all these rules and regulations
Just so you can have your shit heard by the nation and be patient
'Cause by the time they find a lead release, your shit is ancient
You think they're working your album? You're mistaken
And if you flop, you get dropped, 'cause you ain't the star
You didn't go pop, just straight up hip hop, time to get a mop
'Cause without no promotion, of course sales drop
Peep the break down if tapes cost ten
You'll probably only get to see a dollar in the end
That you cannot spend 'cause your budget gets recouped
So you never get cash unless your record is shoop
You better hope you get shows, which will not happen
If you don't have a record that's the main attraction
Even if you sell a million, you'll get burned
'Cause they keep half your cash just in case of returns
For a while, you wonder why rappers don't smile
'Cause to them, you're not an artist, you're just another file
Another nigger used to make another buck
They don't give a fuck and if your shit don't blow up, tough
But the star gets both promotion and devotion
From the whole fucking staff, at you, they laugh
The star probably don't know that he the house nigger
Thinking he bigger 'cause he's the, pick of the litter
These labels think backwards
They push the acts that need it the least
So they can get all the money they can when it's released
They take you to a restaurant for a feast
And then expect you to pick up the check?
That's why I give props to niggaz who is independent
'Cause they make they own money, plus decide how to spend it
Splendid and lets end it and don't get offended
The slave master watching over you
Always trying to tell you what the fuck to do
The slave master watching over you
But ain't nothing gonna stop me and my crew
The slave master watching over you
Always trying to tell you what the fuck to do
The slave master watching over you
But ain't nothing gonna stop me and my crew

I'm blastin' the bass in my headphones
a fool don't have to get his head flown
why waste time with rhymes?
I get straight to the point
like I HATE when funk's in the joint
the hip hop is playin'
sprintin' in to spray men
don't threaten me
or you won't be able to see
when I gouge ya eyes out
I despise doubt
on your part
like I won't stab you in your heart
my flow is drastic
serious, sarcastic
my motto is,
""Phuck with me & get your ass kicked.""
And that's the key to understandin' me
and if they cool then the foot is what you'll be brandin', B
yeah...

""Check It ooooout!"" (Repeat)
I love to peep a rhyme
first of all I'm seein' if my man can keep the time
if he go off beat, and it's on purpose
he gotta come back on the beat
or the effort is worthless
I like ot hear a cool flow
but if it's identical to another, he a fool for it
ya gotta build,
upon skills
and all that copy that most popular rapper shit can get killed
I like a nigga who is quick witted
cause it make me feel like I do, when I come from where my dick splitted
and I admit it, it's a joy
when I hear a nigga avoid the wack and make 'em paranoid
I loves niggas who talk shit
cause that's my department
I got somethin' for anyone who starts shit
cause I'm relentless
with a sentence
a jail sentence, after I beat you senseless
I like niggas when they add rhymes, mad rhymes
then I laugh at niggas who fell off and had rhymes
just some descriptions of what I like to listen to
with my Bruce Banner scanner point of view... ('Pe-urnnnn')
[BRIDGE]
Now I'm bout to clown a bitch
she made my eyebrows twitch
cause she's rich
yeah, real funny
she makes some money
for puttin' other niggas down
you nuthin' but a clown
you can't write
and you're not bright
you fail to notice the dopeness
cause you have no insight
you need to quit
you ain't shit
you need to get a lesson, in hip hop detection
and you're next in my list to jack
it's a fact not fiction
bitch, stop ya bitchin'
you write articles
I'ma rip apart ya skull
cause ya dull
not entertainin'
I'ma put ya brain in orbit
cause I'm morbid
thinkin' a new ways to kill ya
and yo,
I feel ya
ya too critical
and ain't got a bit a pull
just admit it fool
before we get rid of you
a rolling stone gathers no moss
and now who will pay the cost
and afterwards get lost
hit the dirt, before you get hurt
I eat stupid bitches like you and a rhyme for dessert
I bet you never get no dick
you make me so sick
so my pistol is loaded...

I stuck to talkin' shit, instead of setting off the apocalypse
Out in the O, they tryin' to play you like hermits
Out in the O, they'll smoke your ass like sherm sticks
Definitely something to be concerned with
You can't trust these niggas and it's time that I learn this
This nigga that I went to school with
Asked me for five bills, what you gonna do with?
That? 'Bout to give you a whole five dollar bill
If the shit had been real, it wouldn'ta been a big deal
But faultiness strikes, he said
""Let's take a hike up the block
And I'll give you the five out my sock""
I give him two, my homie gave him three
We was both wonderin' what the fuck this gonna be
He took us over to a project building
I was bent off Cisco thinkin'
He said, ""Wait here,"" and I started yellin'
He didn't make clear his intentions while he bailin'
Del infuriated, lost it, I drew the line, he crossed it
It's time to burn his ass like I was caustic
I was screamin', beamin', this lady came out her apartment
And said, ""Bounce, if you're here to start shit, little boy""
She was like
Some shit happened out here last night
Get the fuck out 'cause it won't be no fight
This other nigga came out and said, ""Don't shout
Yo' money gone, take this if you still wanna pout about it""
He opened his hand and I was shocked
In it was a crack rock
I said, ""What the fuck I'm s'posed to do with this, eat it?""
I said, ""Keep that shit"" and then the lady said, ""Beat it""
""He told you your money gone, so get your ass on""
I just did it 'cause I wasn't alone

Transformed, took out a arm, wasn't nothin' but a fiend

For their change now their down in the dumps (Yup)
You spent two yards, to sport em on the first day of school
And like a fool, you went out like the worst way
They pulled out a tool, and asked you to remove them
Quickly, I told em not to do it and they hit me (What?) in the mouth
With the nine, I thought they was like kinfolk (punk)
I never thought crime would elevate up the Twin Oaks way
But hey, everybody is a victim
Hoodz come in dozens, the magic word is (stick em)
When they spot you and they got you and you can't deal with em
All because you spent two G's on your Boomin System
Loud enough for the whole block to hear

(Punk you better raise your ass up out this car)
(Come out off the car punk 'fore your ass gets blasted)
It never was your fault that your shit was expensive
You shoulda bought a vault, and now I gotta mention that
Hoodz come in dozens, read it in the papers
Seems like everyone caught a little vapors
You can't escape em, so don't even plan it
Gangsta Boogie fever has taken over planet Earth
Now your life is worth a pair of Jordans?
Now I wear Vans and my fans think I'm poor
When I walk down the block, with money in my sock and shoe
I hate you Mista Gangsta, cause everyone is mocking you
Now I can't get no rest because you pests keep
Killing little children like their sneakers are worth a million
Bucks, it really is a bummer
Someone tried to get me for a coat last summer
(Your coat, check it in punk, hahah) Damn
Hoodz come in dozens so watch your back
Cause they all on the attack and you'll never know
When they'll show up, but when they do
You better throw up your hands like a fan and surrender
Nigga don't be a pretender
You ain't the Hulk G
Give up the cash and all the big bulky jewelry
(All of it) (In broad daylight?) That's the plan kid
They don't even care if it's candid
Because passerbys mind they own beeswax
So they like steppin' to you like yo I'll take these, black
Give up your cash and your jewels without a argument
Otherwise you'll catch one between the eyes (bang)
Don't play hero, cause hero plus a bullet equals zero
Give up your dough and cheerio old chap

My skin has a pigment, reminiscent of a tan
I plan to grow dreads but first a nappy fro
The longer the hair, the easier to scare a foe
It grows from my head until it covers up my face
People look and stare when I walk into the place
This is just a taste from the Funky Human Being
Ain't no misbehavin', ain't no use for ravin'
Surrounded by the people who would stab me in the back
My skin is really brown even though it's labeled black
Sometimes I wear a cap, and sometimes I wear bandanas
Forbidden in L.A. but I wore one in Atlanta
I chiseled up a sculpture to complement my culture
Thoughts of silly Nubians is prone to give me ulcers
Hangin' with the brothers who are tribal in their ways
For this is how I like to spend my days, and it pays
To steal a groovy sample form the archives
Use my mental staff to eliminate apartheid
Still gather papes like my man Malcom Forbes
Ponderin' my life as I look into my orbs
""Ahonetwo, ahonetwo, I like it""
I love the shade of green like my brother Billy Bixby
I utilize a sample that I salvaged from the 60's cause I'm picky
My meal must appeal to me like Morris
Far too many fraudulent opponents in the forest
I fall into the Gap when I need to purchase clothes
Easy on the fads cause the posers always pose
I suppose they will bite, they'll try not to show it
I came very plain and then feelin' rather loaded
I ditched all the beads cause my needs seem to differ
Me and CM-P are like the Gil and the Skipper
He will use his clippers to give himself a fade
I give my fro a sheen with a smidgen of Pomade
I laid in the shade and I greeted mixel place
With a rhythm and a rhyme and he said that it's a twist
From the ordinary everyday continual assumption that RnB and rap makes a winner
Guess who's comin' through for dinner
A native-like brother with the passive little style
That most certainly will smother
Suicidal rhymes with apocalyptic tunes
I will drink a seltzer while you dabble with the booze
And giggle when I see ya liver shrivel to a prune
I'm the Funky Human Being not a monkey or a coon
Assume that the style is Funkadelic in the 90's

My accent on rap is smashin'
Emcees be past tense
Didn't make the draft pick
Come get ya ass kicked
You awful
And slothful
I'm grease lightning
Hit cha with shit that's uncalled-for
Leave ya jaw broke
Tryna simulate
Gimme a break
You rhyme purely functional
Merely fills the gap
I'm a rhymin' mercenary
I'ma kill the track
My brainstorm cause a cloud bust
Bring forth a rhyme like childbirth
Style search
Tearin' out the whereabouts of lyrics
Somethin' you don't care about
I eviscerate your mental state
Into strips of steak
I'ma situate barbituates to get you baked
Your feminine image is far from intimidating
Cause my style you're imitating
That's as sin as Satan
Your corny insubordinate rhymes are like a porno flick
Prepare to Edgar Allan and spread ya talent thick
You gotta problem with balancing
Ya equilibrium is givin' up
Ya symmetry is imagery
Your videos are pretty dope
Big budget
But my poetry you covet
Mega-destructive
You can't fuck with

This artform is truly endangered
So I change it, never doing the same shit
I'll make a profit off of oxygen

Hit'em wit a sonic boom
Eradicate ya naniploom
Procure of insert a word wit hypodermic earnest
And leave ya burnin' like a furnace

Better beware boy before the shoddy make ya body prostrate

Before they dope make ya eyes dilate

Liftin' crime rates
Shiftin' earth plates

From the man whose mind is not even in this dimension
I'm on another plane, sicker than the mother brain
The ultimate expression, yes indeed
Heed, my flow's symphonic, hypnotic, psychotic
Never semiotic but doper than narcotics
A few a y'all caught it on my first release
But now, my power's increased, enhanced
Del meets the fans halfway, and slap a rapper in his chops
The temperature drops, you get pneumonia
Or maybe exposed to radiation by plutonium
Some say rap's an idiom, get the A S R S P
And then a medium, the best of both worlds
Brilliantly engineered, lyrics dement your fear
Del is now in the clear, I was in prison
But now free to be everything that I envision
Abandon the plan and the uninspired
And the haters that cater to their needs agree
It's bizarre, by far anarchy no control
No soul, the whole fucking planet's gonna fold
Unless we administer, since, as we enter the
Twenty-first century even your worst enemy
Gotta get it together, mentally and systematically
When niggers think I'm a smart-ass, it makes 'em mad at me
Why? 'Cause I try my best to eliminate ignorance
Not letting my brain burn out like cigarettes
There's bigger threats besides thieves or your pet peeves
But what's right in your face is what nobody believes
Del, what you got up your sleeve?
If it was up to me
I would pass the baton 'cause it's tough to lead
But still I drop facts here and there so I can up the seed
So you must believe
Del, what you got up your sleeve?
If it was up to me
I would pass the baton 'cause it's tough to lead
But still I drop facts here and there so I can up the seed
So you must believe X-Files
Lots of rappers today depend on imagery
I myself depend on skills and my energy
It's maddening at every single gathering
Of young black youth it's got to be some niggers badgering
Averaging out to be 'bout three out a G
Now motherfuckers build stereotypes 'cause it's all they see
I take glee in the fact that I'm me
Not a follower, a dollar wouldn't make me sell my soul
Del is old-school compared to your subterfuge
I got the same code of ethics Jungle Brothers use
Now, every nigger wanna be crime related
Can't rhyme creative and they're made of self-hatred
That's why they overstep boundaries that's sacred
From the street to the corporate scene they all mean business
Self for self, phony doesn't work
Your soul holds no weight when you let the Devil lurk
Fighting evildoers I been evil myself
But I'm still a black man with experience under my belt
I may be young but my soul is old
Living in the ice ages where a nigga's soul is cold
Don't give a fuck about your life or his
But if you get a gat for protection, who lives?
Comin' up ain't the same as pullin' everybody else down
But try telling that to niggers that are spellbound
They'll probably say that you talk too much
They gotta think too much
So just be careful who you trust
Del, what you got up your sleeve?
If it was up to me
I would pass the baton 'cause it's tough to lead
But still I drop facts here and there so I can up the seed
So you must believe
Del, what you got up your sleeve?
If it was up to me
I would pass the baton 'cause it's tough to lead
But still I drop facts here and there so I can up the seed

Del, You don't need much proof
When I'm in the sound proof booth, I get loose
Your Excellency, better than the rest of emcees, best with the beat
My capacitors collapse your faders, when I come lackadaisical
That's the way to go
Smash the radio
Pass the gravy too well I behave a fool
High level virtual humanoid, leave your whole crew destroyed
When I switch to manual
Cause I don't stick to manuals
I'm back with panic filled, Manic skills
That weave the tapestry you can't capture me
On video, DVD, or camera
I mangle mice in a maniacal manner
Feed back, fry ya scanners
They wave white banners, like dandruff
Hand cuffed to tracks like a prisoner
non-visionary commentary is a listener

Compelling, unpredictable, how I spit my flow
Get the dough
But rich or poor, I enrich my soul
I can't forget my bro's, that's unforgivable
Live as though you can play, that's when you get stripped to ya bare essence
To finally know your fates stop wastin time and try 2 share lessons
They're guessin, puzzled muzzled
By society undeniably subtle
Technology to make a space shuttle
Technology to make the earth rumble
Get a whiff, it smell like trouble
But Del likes trouble and I don't need a double
Meet it head on, let's hope it's dead on
There's a time for dancing and mind expansion
Tryin to balance, your mind is challenged
To get past lies and violence
Lies and silence, wiped out
Like a surfboard I dun know what hurts more
Knowin, not knowin, or can't controlling
But I control my destiny
In my heart I hold it, I can't let the world get the best of me
[Chorus]
[Verse Three]
Devastating mic control, Levitating master flows
Infrared lyrics snipe ya dome, And I write it like a poem
Notorious like a Poe, a title I have the right to own
Celebrate elevation, And try to make sense outta these statements
I'm information inflated
While emcees done plagerated
Critics don't buy the records
Fans do and I respect that
Del, my signature style is assembled and wild
he can do what he like it's two of me
Both sides of the brain
Watch emcees flow right down the drain
My special moves will rescue you from mediocrity and popular offerings
Operating at a high speed, You don't know yet just try me

Rip niggaz heads with the said salutations.

Choose your weapon; you kept steppin'.
You're swept in a hurricane; Del'll blow your brain,
So your next generations of youth will be facin' the truth,
And the truth is I'll leave you with the loose tooth.
Gums get split if you bit.
I'll extract the truth out your ass, like I'm standin' in the pulpit.
Or a lie dectector wrecked ya sector, when you're standing.
I can swing, branding, expanding, on what I'm handing
To the people, 'cause we will, and you can't say
A damn thing about it if you doubt it.
You're already outta line, so let me remind your behind
About the switch, which I used to bruise your bottom.
That little nigga tried to cut; I caught him.
He didn't think that I would see that.
So be that, and be off the D, 'cause we rap.
We sap the strength and lap the length around the whole course of time,
And still got the time to unwind.

Hurl as your world is crushed because I gotta make you hush.
You gotta be eliminated; the way I demonstrate it.
You hate it, but still I am the greatest.

Nowhere to run to; exits are blocked off.
Steadily I'm dissin' men; I hope you're listenin'.
Brothers like my flow.
Others ride my jock like a bicycle, but I'm psycho.
Fools try to play me like Tyco; gotsta pull the rifle.
Daisy, graze the ass with the B-B.
It comes speedy; sign the peace treaty,
Or you'll be needin'
Medical attention when I leave you bleedin'.
Throw a monkey wrench in your program;
Crammed up your ass and it's just too bad, son;
Catch a bad one.

That saves thee reputation, ya'll let's face it
Ya basin', smokin', leavin' niggas broken and open
But I scope in to ya brain gain and remain
And clues ya use for protection now who's next in

Hi everybody. It's Del the Funky Homosapien, down with Hieroglyphics
Dopest crew in the World, coming with the new '96 shit! Check it out
D-E-L will (""Lick you wid our lyrics!"")
Hieroglyphics will (""Lick you wid our lyrics!"")
D-E-L will, you know, you know!
Hieroglyphics will
Fuck you up!
It's me, really me, not a look-alike
I know some sound alike but when I'm around a mic
Niggas cut! You know the skit
Del ultimate
Rapper international, with that rational style
I get the, shit off my consciousness and
Pull out the compasses
I'm on some shit you ain't around, in the town, clown!
Rebound!
Go get on your intercom and call
Your weakass crew so I can call protocol
I don't give a shit, I wants to get lit (""yeah!"")
Split the Philly roll that bitch!
And it better hits correct and right
Make sure po-po out of sight
Or they gonna have us locked up tonight, sike!
We in the cut with the best bomb available
Peelt out laughin' in a trail of smoke
Oaktown, where niggas get down in more ways than one
It don't stop till the raising sun
Mentally unstable with the rhymes that rock yo' cradle
The author of fatal flows that liquidate emcees
Then I scoop 'em with a ladle
I stay ill and psyched
Outta my mind with mics but gotta be in before sunlight
Emcees approach me with chains of garlic
But their brains are targets
Then I dump off the carcass
A lot of niggas fuss just ''cause we the best for us[?]
Niggas faker with they raps than the Snuffleluffagus
Lifts and bends, I recommend
Before I make blood suspend
When I check that chin
It's common knowledge Mr. Del demolish (""You ain't know?"")
Taking you back to the days of cornbread and collards, come on!
(chorus)
(""Lick you wid our lyrics!"")

Yeah!
I perceive more than the average madness
Niggas get the giggles when they find my shit is pivotal
The radical, hip-hop fanatical who do what's natural
Actual fact, no tact, you'll get intercepted!
Kept it away, from emcees ''cause they
Wouldn't know what to do wit' it
Pursuing it don't mean you gonna catch it
I slay willing women backwards on the mattress
At this access got niggas yackin'
I'm crackin' safes and niggas actin' fake
I got the date to arrange your weight
About spent every cent on the bomb
Fuck being calm, I'm like a shell-shocked vet from 'Nam
So turn to Psalms, get your palms off my dick
Before I go sick and make yo' ass hit the bricks
I used to stay on 57th the resident bussed to havin' it [?]
To stay out late at night ''cause none of these niggas is Heaven-sent
I'm bent, puffin' killer-Cali hit the vent
I lend my voice to tracks, as we's the instrument
A Public Service Announcement on how I house shit
I hope your blouse fit, bitch, you fight with fists
But if I ask you ""Let's battle"" you might resist
I wax that ass on Pay-Per-View and invite Tha Liks
The steel-cage grudge-match where there's no escape
I'll peel that cap like bananas to apes
Oh yeah! them niggas, it figures
The masterminds behind the rhymes you claim were yours
We lick off with rhymes like Nas and make your brains stain the floors
At last we clash under the overpass
(speaking)
Del: Damn, we've been waiting here for hella long, since 12
Opio: I'm tellin' you, man, they don't wanna see me on the mic
I'm tellin' you
Del: All these fake ass niggas
Opio: That's why they ain't came.
They heard me, man, they done heard me, man, I'm tellin' you
Del: Talkin' about they the freestyle masters, they'll get they ass ate
Opio: And they sound just like you anyway, man, we out on these fools
Del: I know man, let's be out
(chorus 1x)
Yeah! We got the beat (""You know!"")
(""Lick you wid our lyrics!"")
There ain't no doubt about it, we got the beat (""You know!"")
(""Lick you wid our lyrics!"")
From Oakland, to all around the World (""You know!"")
(""Lick you wid our lyrics!"")
You know what? We got the beat

We 'bout to roll to the corner me and my crew
We 'bout to roll to the corner and get us some brew
We 'bout to roll to the corner and get some swishers too
So we can role a fat blunt and get perfed
Another fine day in this land I live
Oakland we're they don't give a shit and that's it
You know I'm sellin' they can split the profit 50 50
With this other brother who went in half with me
Now, first before we burst the move
We gotta sooth our nerves with the liquor
Then we don't bicker
We'll be relaxed ask your mama
This shit is like a war zone
Streets is hot like the Bahamas
But we will stay away from the drama
I'm wearin' my snipe, my arctic jacket with the wool like a llama
Then we had to pause like a comma
Cause someone got stuck and buck and family was outside with trama
We heard the shots from inside and went there when the gats go off
I hit the deckin' high
And a popo said they got their own time they lie
But you gotta give them credit they try
I see a mother cry and I'm wondering why
And my man said fuck it aint nothin' we can do
But to continue our mission down the block for the brew
And we out (yeah, yeah)
[Chorus 2x]
On our way we 'bout half way there
Children runnin' everywhere like they just don't care
The Muslim Bakery is like right between
And if I pass by with beer they will look at me mean
So I ducks in and gets my Final Call now
Cause still my brain gotta be well endowed and proud
The ambulances signals and glances
So let's hurry up and take no chances
Niggas step to us trying to rap like we got all the answers
In front of the store trying to work that slide ahead
The pant handlers they got no amateurs
Daily reminders of how I gotta find a way to come up
And sums up life along with the kids and a wife
But anyway
We pass the local grocery store
And you can be sure the meats and the products aint good no more
Some of it is from days before
I want it fresh and the clerk ain't my race so he stress
They doin' me in my community
Fuck it, we there
Aint enough for a 6 pack so we had to share
A nice little strole through the April spring air
We hide on shit so the nation don't see it there
[Chorus 2x]"
2315,bm-s,2007,del-the-funky-homosapien,Hip-Hop,"Ahh
First day off probation, no wastin' time
Just like ancient times, and take a dime and roll it
Blaze it with no fear
After havin' to take piss tests for a whole year
Smokin' with a cold beer makes me kinda think
Why I don't like to drink heavily, 'cause what my P.O. was tellin' me
'You can't smoke, can't even eat poppy seeds
But you can buy liquor, and drink all you need'
It's callin' me, I used to drink Heineken's
Now it's 'bout 5 or 10, plus wine and gin
Hennessy, finishing the last drop
To the liquor store was a cash crop
Drive right past the grass spot
Doin' the dumbest shit I ever did in my life
Riskin' my life,
Resistin' arrest
It's in my flesh
Probably smell funny
And there go Del's money
Fast forward to 1998
I smash more herb than those old day's
But a whole J to the face?
Nah, I'm still feelin' gettin' drunk more than weed
But now we back in Amster-D, got some grams for me
Chocolate Thai, Purple Haze
And blocks of hash that make the J's last for days
Rollin' 'em so fat, circumference stuffed with major chronic
We can put a wager on it
When we first got out here in Europe beer was everywhere
Even at the gas station, I was downin' them at
A fast pace, when I thought 'This shit ain't helpin' nothin'
When I can get elevated straight puffin' nothin''
Chorus:
(Scratching) Straight puffin' nothin'...
(Scratching) Straight puffin' nothin'...
(Scratching) Straight puffin' nothin'...
The smokin' sessions was the best in the world
Plus the price was right, affordable, so more to use
So fat they deserve the Kodak
And no tax so I'm savin'
Not misbehavin'
That's a risk we takin', we ain't talkin' bout that
We in the outback, smokin' till my mouth's black, how's that?
I never fucked up a show being blowed
I sorta didn't get it crunk
When I was drunk
Slow that liquor down boy, hit this BM, Bob Marley
A tribute
'Cause it was probably as fat as the ones he rolled
When he strolled
Down the same cobble stone streets
With his own beats
Another generation, a different time zone
With his mind blown, thinkin' up divine poems
Blessed by the father and it gets him farther
With spiritualities, since it all affects the Karma
I used the herb for good purposes
Some people are sure to diss, but up in Amsterdam they nurcher it
And I can't forget about Crystania
This kid is brainia
Try to sell hard drugs there then they claimin' ya
Life, they only deal with real shit
All the bomb and hash you want to deal it
And all's well, they don't even sell it for much
And the cops don't really touch, 'cause it ain't slangin' dust
I'm writin' this, right now under the influence
With impudence towards those that say I shouldn't do this
Bob Marley'd out, at least 'til I'm back by the lake
But I might roll 1 or 2 for old times sake...

[Chorus]
You got to know what your love is worth
Baby boy you got to know what your love is worth
Baby girl you got to know what your love is worth
Everybody got to know what their love is worth
Yeah, you got to know what your love is worth
As soon as a child is born and discovers earth
It's a part of life, so don't get fucked in the end
If someone's a lost cause, they'll be summoned up to start again
Example, you a woman, in a relationship
It seems like everything you do makes him flip
It ain't physical violence, or nothing like that
But the love that you show he doesn't show back
But it started when you first met
You looked incredible to him, he wanted to get his thirst wet
(yeah, I bet)
He wanted to be down like Brandy
At first his overbearing persona was so manly (oh)
But now you're thinkin' most of the time, ""he can't stand me""
He lost trust in you when he saw you with Randy (haha)
But then you find out he feel good about Candy
You thinkin' this relationship is really demanding
Everyone makes mistakes and that's true
But from the beginning did he really love you?
To him you a bitch, he told his boys he dug you out
And nowadays he don't even hug you (doubts)
And I'm sure it do more than bug you
You wonder how you get attracted to these
With a mackin' disease, with a tactic to please
But once you settle down you're entrapped in a squeeze
Like a boa constrictor and he know when he gets ya
You got to know what your love is worth
That way you don't waste it on the world goin berserk
Yeah
[Chorus:Repeat x2]
Now put yourself in the shoes of this guy
You fall in love with this girl and you don't know why (why dude?)
Cause you don't feel the same but you give it a try
Eyes wide, like you a child in a candy store
Even though you the one she couldn't stand before
Cause you was houndin' her, surroundin' her (damn) with confusion
You used to be friends, but now the friendship is losin'
Cause you visualize the romance, she like ""no hands on""
She don't want to fuck with no man, ""not even a slow dance?""
You tried to kiss her and she even agrees
But that don't mean you 'bout to be Adam and Eve
In the Garden of Eden, but maybe for the evening
You say she leading you on, but you just added pressure
Of course she like you, you're friends don't try to test her
She says she likes you as a friend, not a lover or wife
So get a life, let her live hers and find another
Don't let her smash her ego, cause we know you're great
Let it be her mistake, yeah
Don't waste your time bro cause you know
If she don't appreciate what he do for her
Then tell me why he should wait around"

fillin' gaps in the space

That's another genre, I'm the black bomber
Track charmer, sack burner
Distract burdens if it ain't that urgent
Nerve prints word sentinel, invisible, infidel interstellar
Hella clever, endeavors immeasurable
With only heaven to go incredible
Melodramatic wit tales from the tablet
You fail 'cause you average
Regardless of your sells and your status
You extra baggage
I bamboozle like I'm mobbin' in a land cruiser
Down MacArthur, artistic archer, autistic misfit
You'll get the sickness
When I spit the wickedness
And split cha wig like Kid Icarus
Leave you headless like Icky-bod

My throat holds verbal choke pose
Po-po's in ya scrolls, my goals are not rifles
I flow scrimmage like the Microdots
You might go pop and I might grow crops
Go get the gestapo, you riskin' a pot full of gold
Pull a zodiac sign to halftime
Reenact rhymes from a past life of a flashlight
Man, you don't know the half
Dash right to the phonograph
Blow your balderdash
Coordinates confirm, subordinates will learn
My ordnance is stern so supportin' my fern
Is the only way in this lonely age where you goin' crazed
Your style is sold and paid for 'cause I made more
Water emcees like a bayshore
Bullets graze doors
In Oakland where they lay law
Del is going AWOL wit' napalm
Eight bombs taped to my arms like the town crier
Now miser, strider, spit exciter, rippin' plywood
Forget beef cakin' lyrical cheapskates
Try Del and win the sweepstakes
What I make is so hot, it's seethin'
Off the deep end, stop your breathin'
Caught cha sleepin'
Now you're peekin' like you've eaten
A hundred microdots wreck your equinox
Delete every piece of props
Leave your perforated, curb your hatred
Deserve your matrix in the Word Olympics
Completely furnished wit' burners like Ted Turner

Prevailing, curtailing, you're shattered with data
Directed, my method, hectic, try and dissect it

I'm sick of fools actin' like they blacker than me
Y' know, usually bourgeois

For inner street jerks who wanna flirt with our sound
But ain't really down, silly clowns
Barnum and Bailey rejects
Press eject on defects
These threats delivered signed and sealed by the Delmeister
German for master, burnin' the blasphemous

Yo D, link up the cable we'll go hit for hit
Phantasma plasma particle beam means I have you
On the run, the rendered effects hot like magnas
I play games by Capcom with a power glove strapped on
On any platform, I don't spend my dough on Phat Farm
Video games, I got many to play
Before my life expires to fill my desires
Mastering your hardest boss, shattering all stars across
Ain't hard to cross the finish line, floatin' on Daytona
Wex, Gex or Kloana, I get 'em all at cost
RPG, Platform we transform like Macross
Rival schools, Batsu purchase you ought to
It came with one free CD, it's like I bought two
I hope they make part II for Dreamcast
'Cause games I've seen in mags, you won't believe they have
Getting callouses turning over asteroids, graviton bombs destroyed
Getting moms annoyed, now I'm hacking Nightmare Creatures
Their features splattered across the screen
It gets more clean each year
I remember, my homie Ed Coats had the most
A Colecovision, every week I'd visit
Playing Donkey Kong Jr., Venture, Rock and Rope
Games I thought was dope while my mom's was watching soaps
I'm on the next level
I got a double barrel shotgun in the Doomworld
Waiting on the next devil, armor's low, check the arsenal

Come visit Feudal Japan with me and Tenchu
Bushido Blade 2 with sword play so accurate
Mega Man Legends but I had to buy a map for it
I fence Hyo to get a Neo-Geo
For Samurai 64 in full rendered splendor
Rival counter and enter, my sword in his innards
My joint was being Leonardo wuppin' on Splinter
I gotta get Xenogears, that's the type of game that relieves my fears

I gotta get Psychic Force, authentic arcade that I can endorse

I like bass when it hums
And that sums up my properties for the dumb-dums
Someone need to check him
Deck him
Slam him
And put him in the bushes
So 'shush' kids
No one needs to know
I'll proceed & go into
And then tell ya what I've been through.

""In one ear, right out the other,
Go tell ya sister, go tell ya mother,
In one ear, right out the other,
Go tell ya father, go tell ya brother,
In one ear, right out the other.""
I would feel comfortable
If your front would go elsewhere
Or disappear
Hear my specific style that's speaking
Creeking, making noises in the nightime
When I write rhymes
I look out my window
It's a bright day
And I might display my skills in the hills
Or, in a different neighborhood
Cause my flavor could
Be the best, so lets test this
Yes, bitch
I saw you posted at the pool table
I could never talk to you
But now a fool's able
With the best of luck
And, hey, how do you impress a duck?
By pullin' out a wad of bucks
Shucks
I need to stop this
I plop this, played this
I murder MCs
& leave their pens inkless
Do you think this is a twist
A turn, I insist
To burn those foes who haven't learned
To keep they mouths closed
Guinness Stout flows
Through your intestines, when life is depressin'
I built my foundation using patients
Some didn't hear us
Some had to state it...

Give me the keys, I'm OK
Quit tellin' me I'm drunk, I only had five Hurricanes
Quit bein' such a Puritan, I'm a mega-turrican (?)
Wakin' up and it's all a blur again
If I'm alive...
If I'm alive...
If I'm alive...
If I'm still alive...
Red Skull more like skull and crossbones
Took my driver's test straight pilin' over the cones
It ain't funny so don't you dare chuckle
Drivin' hella drunk without my beltbuckle
Fuck you, I'm OK
That's what they all say
Already got a suspended license
Smokin' weed in my ride and lightin' incense
Not knowin' it could be gone in an instant
Pistons pumpin', slumpin'
Over the steering wheel
So many drunk drivers on the road
It's killing fields
Who gives a fuck?
If I get caught all I get
Is a slap on the wrist
My license tooken is a bitch
But I still drive with a D.U.I.
Crash, see my passenger fly
Through the windshield
It's hard to see you die
Heads crushed, necks severed from the shards
That's what happens playing with a wild card
How do you feel on trial for killin' your girl?
Nineteen years old, the end of the world
Don't know what to do
Pop's is gonna' kill you
Twelve gauge shotgun to your grill smooth
Got you in a predicament
If I'm drivin' drunk I've got a sickness
Some fool's is shiftless
Like me, gifted
Student GPA: four point oh
Blood alcohol level past that though
(scratched:)
I never drink and drive
''cause I might spill my drink
[Chorus]
Three o'clock, time to go
One more line of coke with cognac
But my cognitive skills ain't on the shit
What now Sherlock?
Key to the lock
My friend's is tellin' me to stop
Damn near down the block
I found cops in the bushes peekin'
Plus it's the weekend and I'm off the deep end
I roll through an alley way, can't see
Getting ansy I hop on the interstate but it's late
Cops patrol but I don't give a fuck though
I swerve to the right and get stuck in a mudhole
Check the rearview, the coast is clear
Tryin' to focus here but I can't
Drunk as hell, bust a rail
Now I'm sailin' off the cliff
High off the spliff, plus a fifth
I bust my shit
Now I'm rollin' down the side like a suicide
What will my family do if I die?
Tension builds, I went through hills and trees
Stopped by a redwood first thing broke was knees
I feel pain then a split second later
Car burst into flames, they won't know my name
They'll have to check my dental records
My body is charred
Burnt to a crisp soon as the car flipped the crash
That's my ass, a thing of the past
Already dead by the impact of airbags
(scratched:)
I never drink and drive
''cause I might spill my drink
If I'm alive...
If I'm alive, If I'm still alive...
If I'm alive...
If I'm alive, If I'm still alive...

I won't get you yet
So no sweat
You're no threat
I bet I can belt your brain
When my scalpel felt your brain
You convulsed
No pulse
We lost him
Cost him his life
Phukkin around
It's too easy to buck 'em down
Let 'em drown
Face down in a toilet
Take his brain and boil it
Watchin who I tell 'cause they'll spoil it
They might reveal

Keep your lips sealed
Or yo might be the next to keel over

Refer to us
When you feel the need
To bleed your chicken feed
Yeah, plead for mercy
Before I burst free
I'm blood thirsty

While they waited

It seems nowadays friends step to me bogus
And end up on my couch at night without notice
It's cool to have a friend over every
Now and then but I gotta have my space
And I don't wanna see their face
Like every single day of the week, talk is cheap
You betta find yourself another place to sleep
It ain't my fault that ya moms got fed up
And now you wanna come to my crib and wet my bed up
You better find a job so you can get an apartment
And you can save your crocodile tears don't even start with
The sob stories I got enough from the other
Seven brothas in the den playin' genesis
Damn I can't win at this
Seems like I'm gonna have to flip
And tell those other brothas that they're gonna have to skip
I've had it up to here with these lazy cats
They keep sleepin' on my couch and I'm tired of that
Get your lazy butt up off my couch
People come to my house and kinda wonder where the squadron's at
They're not gone, they're just down at the laundromat
Because they wear the same pairs of clothing
I'm taking up crazy patience just holding my temper
I'm about to start charging rent for
Every single brother that kicked it with my mother eating
Biscuits on saturday morning like a family
The minute they step it's like moms is crazy mad at me
Cause they're in my mother's room watching television
I feel like giving 'em the boot and say the hell with 'em
But if I give 'em the boot I'm not a friend though
Even though my room smells like dime bags of indo
But I can't pretend like I haven't been peepin' it
Even mom knows that my brothas been sleepin' on
My couch for weeks so your speeches fall flat
They keep sleepin' on my couch and I'm tired of that
Get your lazy butt up off my couch
Maybe this was just my upbringing perhaps
But I was taught that I shouldn't take seven day naps
At other brothas' cribs like I don't have a home
Brothas on my couch so much there's like foam
Coming out the seams and a pair of jeans
Is missing from my closet, I wonder why I even bother being friendly
They're running my ass like the indy 5000
They went and wrinkled my mother's blouse
When they snuck downstairs for a midnight snack
And ate the last slice of bread and a box of apple jacks
Then they hit the sack with the stereo blastin'
And even little tyson is fed up, so I'm askin'
You all to jet, before I get upset
And throw each and every one of you bums out on your back
My house is a mess, so step ya little pest
Who was sleepin' on my couch cause I'm tired of that
Get your lazy butt up off my couch"

Del, champion of true I do what the others can't do
So when ya come to, recognize I despise weak
I'm at my peak I seek more then the boredom that you are accustomed to
The conoseur I love hip-hop more, then I did as a kid so I gotta get rid
Of those who pose, case closed
I'm dynamic with panic and that's exactly how I planned it
[Chorus]
You better peep 'cause the price steep for those who sleep
I pile my rhymes by the heap on cassettes, Lp's, cd's and 12 inches
Perform the shit and get the girl like pinches
With good intentions, the key word is redemption
For those who try to shit on my crown let's get down
Plastic ass rappers get smashed like crackers
First I shalack ya and hit ya with the lacquer
Then I go to marijuana class to study cultivation
So I can make the USA a better nation
Get smoked, mellow out, vibe fuck the stress
While I kill MC's that say ""he's relentless.""
Past you at last due to technological enhancements on my part the art advances
My rhymes are ravishing, ravaging the hip-hop surface
To get to the underground for pounds and purchase
Merciless, as soon as I insert the disc
into the SP to make the world stress me
Let's be upfront and real
What's up with this rap regurgitation that appeal to the masses?
I got pure plain funk hold the Mayo
Like the formulation of ice crystals make the suns halo a rainbow
Painful to MC's at large I barge and bulldoze them all when I charge
Personally responsible, behind all the hoopla
Haven't crossed the board, get the troubleshoota

Stress the world...( make the world stress me)
Stress the world...( make the world stress me)
Stress the world...( make the world stress me)
Let's be upfront and real
Mathematically correct, collect wreck on the daily
This ain't Prince project put out on plays the part
Deep dark funk to dunk your face in
Fully animated in a time when hip-hop's contaminated
Wit corny niggaz talkin jibberish they make me feverish
I merely pull this lever which enables me to unveil tails of Del in action
Smoked to fullest, project my voice like bullets
I deflect you sect. I check the scanner
Damn you're persistent, I stand wit my fist clenched
Tightly around the microphone like a septer
Wit rhymes average MC's can't see like a specter
The inspector with the nectar, sharp like a Black and Decker
I twist a nigga neck like chubby checker
Respect the Hieroglyphic insignia
you know it means murda wit lyrics unhearda
Stamina, stamina. And wit a new flow to boot
Don't try to execute my patter-ns
I took hella notes while battlin'
Dismantlin' opponents alone with my trusty verbs leavin' MC's disturbed
Everybody on my block know I rock
To MC's I'm hella cocky so I keep my rhymes cocked in position
And if you actually listen to what I'm sayin' you'll see you can't resist 'em
They're succulent and if you don't like them fuck you then
Anybody with taste see it's a delicacy
Not a mere orderve or haven't you heard
And it's totally take out about a million served like that
Absolutely a beauty to crush the shit that's booty
'cause I figures it's my duty

Verbally, every word will be enhanced
With the bass that'll put you in a trance
Some dance, come take a chance
Del won't do you wrong
I've been in the rap game too long to falter
I rock like Gibraltar
Make you kneel to the butt like an altar
We move to prove that this is improved, when you're at-water
Caught em with vibration that soothes your back like massages
Before you can park your car in garages
It'll be just for riders, listening to 'Rock The Bells'
You can barely hear the vocals
Mixing is important, getting the public into chokeholds
Hip hop homo's will do well to know this
It ain't about who's the dopest
It's who gets the fan's focus upon you
When they feel what the song do
I think I'm onto something, when I got my shit pumping
I remember, when they were satisfied with just lyrics
Now, if the music 's flat
I can barely stand to hear it
And my rhymes are impeccable and you can't dissect my flow
With music sounding like it's out of tin cans
Just wretch the whole vibe and stride for perfection
Why you think they call this a profession? Hey
[Chorus: x2]
Can't forget the bass, the bottom got em crawling to the wall man
We got cassettes, CD's and LP's
DJ's for days, whatever you do
Give it your all, cause that's what pays
I just love when I can hear the bump pleading to the walls
In the halls, coming from the record stores in the malls
A beat with walls I like that
It bites back and strikes back
At niggaz who are wack, 'cause
Back in the day when hip hop was just developing
It was back in the day
We should be relishing in experience
All you newcomers better be leery cause
Hieroglyphics got the bump
And it ain't mysterious
[Chorus]
This don't apply to the niggaz who salved
And fell out of their fam base
Trying to chase the big bucks
It sucks, I know, when your heroes want to appear to hoes
Supermacho! And watch the whole role and image of a mic champion
To the fam base it simply can't be done
'Cause they're your folks when you don't get the prop shit
They know you got the top shit and in it only for profit
But since we on the topic, let me drop it
We need to stop this segregation of hip hop
Talking 'bout fuck the east coast, and fuck the west
He's sold out, cause someone either sings a notion in the chorus
What is real hip hop then? Only the shit you listen to
Everything else pretending, I'm sending a message to my fam base
Fuck this is hip hop and this is rap, it came from the same place
And there's a place for everything including hieroglyphics
And we gonna come with it, as long as y'all with it
'Cause the fam base is like a legion
For one cause, we want the dope shit cause
The other got flossed ??? Now
I'm a fan who likes a lot of different things
I differentiate with music just to spread my wings
I always do my best, that's why the fans love me
Not some crime shit, so I can pop bubbly
We all got some preferences, that's just how it goes
But when you see there's an effort being made, don't turn up your nose
Turn up the bass, race to go and buy it
Some of y'all love it - don't you, don't deny it

'cause his toe had the sniff of crustaceans
Or bathrooms in a bus station
He had a can of Olde E and some raisins
Amazing... head to toe B.O.

Or else you'll be funkyyyyyyyy"
2332,town-to-town,2007,del-the-funky-homosapien,Hip-Hop,"They say that nice guys finish last, but I'm the leader
Drinkin' liters of Seagrams with the heathens
Misbehave and break the buzz, fuck the shavings
Collectin' scratch for my savings before the day ends
Cravings for music, collaborate at a rate
Faster than the speed of sound to go thataway
No replicas, step to us, I guess the job was left to us
To kick the phonics that kept you buzzed
And perkin', workin' words, distributin' herbs
To niggas livin' in 'burbs cause they too petro
To come to the ghetto
Mind you, all we do is find you, wave and gave you a sack
Come back but watch 50, they try to lift me
Off the tracks but we ain't offerin crack, just bomb
No need for alarm or bad karma, but arm yourself
Move in stealth, wealth is accumulated
Pockets are illuminated
I make the shit I think hit even though some assume you hate it
I pass judgment when the fuzz lit, take a shit
Just another skit comin' from the pit of Babylon
But powerful like Alvatron
From the Decepticons
Music is magical like a leprechaun
Kept you on point in many different sectors
On Elektra, make you remember Medgar Evers and James Evers
My skills sent from the heavens
I wish they sold Maddog at 7-11
I remember when niggas wore Thriller jackets
And Starter jackets and harder tactics
Had been adopted and most of y'all mocked it
But put a sock in it for a minute
I provide the funk and y'all rock with it
As I spit it, admit it, oh shit
[Chorus]
It's Del the Funky Homosapien
Goin' from town to town to town and just makin' friends
Reach out and shaking hands
With the public and they love it
No technical difficulties or faultiness, you salt me with
That plain-Jane-no-game-insane-to-the-brain
Don't need cocaine fuckin' with the A
The A-Pluster plus the A from way back in the day
For mind expansion enhancing thoughts
I'm raw with savagery, the majesty of all in vision
Wait, but isn't this a good way to start?
Developin' art to cart scrill to kill Satan
Plans for gettin' Daytons are past tense
Stack ends so I won't be a has-been (You know it)
The question you been askin: Is Del that masked man?
Rollin through our cities just rippin' major venues
Like Whitney Houston like when I went to Houston
My father is from Texas, so next bust a rhyme for times
I felt it was no hope, but no factors you formulate
Made me foster hatred and made me want to make it
When I'm in the Bay niggas say (Del, how you doin, man?)
I ain't no rap star that act hard, can't speak
I leak lyrics, freak lyrics, secrete lyrics
From my spirits
Tyranny for all who hear of me
Bomb in a bong, my feet in a thong
On a beach with a biatch named Bonbon
Called her on the Intercong, enter John Owens
Better known as Casual to y'all not knowin'
About flowin, cause your rhymes are all stolen
Another dip on the strip cause task force patrollin'
But rollin' blunts too fat to measure
Mexico's national treasure for pleasure
Resurrect tracks like this from my childhood
Before it was such a wild hood
Knock on wood
[Chorus]
My beats are meaty
Let's call a peace treaty
And stick to it
I'm quick to do it, are you?
So much funk you can't kick it with my crew
Other than when it's time to get blue?
(Shame on you)
I want me a girl that's intelligent
Doin' shit and ain't too belligerent
Picture it, chillin' backyard barbecue
Not trippin' off what niggas are to you
Jealousy, well let's see
It's a lot of that in Oakland
It started when niggas started smokin'
And snortin' hop, fuck pop
I want the melodies
But not the weak topics you are selling me
Del is free of confinements
My mind bendin' fragile and frazzled
I choose to stay underground like Fraggles
In battles I'm sure to win
While you smoke bud I drink gin
It sinks in while everyone else act on it
I macked on it but not too far from redrum
Don't push me, I'm not a pussy
I wish we could gather at a function, drink some lager
And just bust hymns of funk and flav
'Cause the slaves that are our ancestors
Would feel blessed if we did that
Before we hear rap
Now it's American children syntax
Ever since it been on wax
And that's the facts, believe it, don't mislead it
And don't do the shit if you don't need it
And that's real, you might not be but I am
The truth's gonna slap you in the face, so why scam?
[Chorus]"

The same ol' thing (got to get 'em with it)
The same ol' thing (MCs out there got)
The same ol' thing (so let me tell ya bout it)
MCs keep comin' with the same ol' thing
With the same ol' swing, with the same ol' ending
The same ol' climax cause many have no vertebrae
Yo, but D-E-L and Hieroglyphics have to murder a
Fraudulent foe real quick and get them off of our dicks
Show the public that they ass ain't slick
They lack skills and they can only thrill ya by dance steps
I coulda iced Vanilla, but I haven't got the chance yet
But that's okay cause he was dissed on Soul Train
He got booed because his rhymes are so lame
He ain't the only one, he's far from it
There's more on Earth and they're all gonna plummet
Like falling stars because a brother's in charge
I'mma stomp mud holes in they ass like they was El DeBarge
Then charge to the front of the class
Suckers everywhere like broken glass, yo
But I'mma keep troopin' through the Meadow with the fellow
Named X and a pillow, to sock the pussy willows
While I get dough as I grow as a rhymer
And they can keep showin' their teeth like Aunt Jemima
It's the same ol' thing
The same ol' thing (all over the world)

The same ol' thing (all over the world)
The same ol' thing (got to get 'em with it)
The same ol' thing (MCs out there got)
The same ol' thing (so let me tell ya bout it)
I'm in your face with force to eliminate monotonous
Braggin' and boastin', so most will end up profitless
Cause they ain't got a foot to stand on
And I'mma leave the stage bloodier than a tampon
I can't get no rest because of gamin' little pests
Will step and try to test me with the same ol' thing
I wish it would stop but more than likely it will not
Cause too many MCs got the same ol' thing
So I change and rearrange rhyme patterns
Keep ya mind scatterin'
From the solar system
And I still dissed 'em
The ones with the crumbs on they lips
Talkin' about Sucka MCs that don't exist
And I get the gist so don't play me like a imbecile
Thinkin' that ya large, but ya small as a thimble
Plus I get mental over funky tracks
And ya still talkin' Sucka MC's? That shit is wack
If I ever dissed an MC it was one with a name
So don't tell me he was one in the same
Because I know better, I flow better than the average Joe
I use my Nubian stick to overthrow
That same ol' thing
The same ol' thing (all over the world)
The same ol' thing (got to get 'em with it)
The same ol' thing (MCs out there got)
The same ol' thing (so let me tell ya bout it)
The same ol' thing (all over the world)
The same ol' thing (got to get 'em with it)
The same ol' thing (MCs out there got)
The same ol' thing (so let me tell ya bout it)
MC's out there got the same ol' thing, got the same ol' game
And trip, some got the same ol' name
Like Rockmaster This, Mighty Kingathat
Who died and left you the Wolfman, Jack?
But the Boogiemen are irregular
Spectacular, Dracula, and plus we're gettin' clever
I never had the urge to ass a tag to my title
And I won't add a (rah) or a (huh) at the end of my recital
Hip hop hibbit
I never say a rhyme like that cause I can take my time and give it
Thought
So I went and bought
A pen and pad
Now I'm makin' MCs real mad
Like Young MC goin' out like Sugar Hill
Add a new beat, new rhyme, bogus still
And even if we are in the same gang it ain't no need
For all MC's to have the same ol' thing
The same ol' thing (all over the world)
The same ol' thing (got to get 'em with it)
The same ol' thing (MCs out there got)
The same ol' thing (so let me tell ya bout it)
And it's gettin' mighty ancient"

Who don't show love with all you sun and your thun

And deep in the wound
Your conscious creep in the tomb
Speaking in togues
Reaping the sums

And prepare for the scare of 1991, yo
Brothers get dumb without no remorse, yo
Gas they hand and then they thrown off course, yo
I coulda told ya so, I'm no dummy
Girls out there will act funny for the money
If ya rollin' in dough, she'll treasure ya
Instead of a pager she carries a cash register
It's cool for the fool that just happens
To be a crack dealer or rappin'
Back in the day it wasn't no problem
Cause it was ok, to just have a job then
But, nowadays ya gotta have the status
But, natives ain't goin' for the madness
Hey, they're barely outta their teens
16 and 17 year olds livin' like queens
Cause, honey trips without the checks
And ayo, money trips without the sex
So next is somethin' that natives don't need
Headaches and heartaches and I refuse to partake
In money for sex in any form or fashion
All ya hopes and dreams I'm like smashin'
And I know otha brothas know how I feel
So you can step cause (it ain't no big deal)

Where, oh where did the good girls go?
It seems all that's left in the meadow is hoes
Not the kinda ho that you use in your garden
Yes the kinda ho that'll make your dick harden
But it's more than a dolla for a holla
And more than a thousand for a peak up her blouse, and
More than a million if ya have children
Cause nowadays girls wanna make like a killin'
So babies come in handy
And they'll just eat up your dough like candy, give her some Brandy
And let her roll around in the Benz
And she'll give up the crotch and brag to all her friends
Thinkin' they can play me like a field trip
That's why I slugged my honey dip
Cause that's more than I can stand and I'm the man who sets it right again
Bust they in the lip and the bitch will never bite again
You ain't gettin' with my Nubian brothers
Cause before you even hit them covers
I warned 'em
Told 'em what was up before you bitches even swarmed him
Cause they'll be next
If I didn't hip my brothers to the sex
So you can try to rob and steal
But we were right on ya heels because (it ain't no big deal)
""Money for sex, money for sex, ring it up""
You say crack sellers are swell fellas
Takin' you to school in his 5.0
Like I don't know that your boyfriend is paid
Ya musta told me 18 times, the other day
Bamboo earrings and gold teeth
And I know you must be givin' up the whole piece
He's just payin' for the sex
And I know you prostitutes is playin' with the sex
So who's next? Don't think that you can play the Homosapien
Cause I got plenty of friends
That's like waiting in the trenches
And I know your intentions
You wanna be down with a rapper
So you clap your
Thighs around my legs like a sandwich, but I'm not famished
Your schemes and plots are outlandish
Tan is the color of my skin, but
False is the color of your grin
So you can't win, this ain't no joke
And honey dip you can quote
Note for note
And squeal like a billygoat
And tell your friends that Del is stuck up
But in reality you fucked up
Now nubians ain't givin' money for the sex
And ayo, Nubians ain't givin' money for the sex
You stuck out in the cold
Like a mole on my asshole
Cause brothers ain't givin' up another red cent for the sex

Gregarious with verbals for your merriment

Here we go, up jumps the outcast, sever the connection

To the anti-potions and fear that I drip sick in
And rise out of my shell to teach sick or bedridden emcees

Blockin' the cocks that bust shots, spittin' smitten bitches
'Til the day of the locust, kitchen cutlery cuts
DMX 16 cross fade with a strange lust
Dr. Strangelove, born in the back of the train, fameless shame
Shared with acne pick brain pit
Tried to capture the moment of subtle death
Destro magnet spit, action fit into capsules
Slipped in the dirty waterway speaker cabinets
Maximum b-boy axiom stabbin' shit
Intellectual women find that my rhyme style relaxes them
And wonder if I fuck to the same rhyme style pattern
It's autobahn pipe bomb glass fragment
Shatter to break new jacks at after parties for actin' actual
Factor X into your formula for fresh thoughts
With a Megalon wingspan that bulge from the back of the text radical
Radio time tracks flatten your flattery
The tradition excuse used by biters, ambiguously homo
Knotted tights and colored underwear
That's wrapped around the brittle legs of things without weapons
I'm grief diseased brethren
Swim in a sea of shit and malt liquor, feed on Excedrin
Radiate through tenements, emcees bleed estrogen
Watch insanity increase, break it up piece by piece
Never weak in the least, think you better see a priest
Mortality, don't battle me, it's costly
We the raw breed, all of y'all is just the offspring
Yo Del, kick that shit again
Tomahawkin' your tom-tom club
You tried to holler at me at my show, lookin' like you on drugs
You love the Del, I'll thug you, bumpin' Juvenile
Thinkin' you in style, packin' like you movin' now
I move top speed, scot free with cock-D
Knock-kneed delivery that scorches you like Lockheed
Dr. Decibel, my deliverance is questionable
But as far as this session goes, I'm wreckin' skulls
Better check your pulse, we visionaries with this
Scarin' the shit outta record labels next to fatal
Right beside homicide, bona fide bewilderment
Militant diligence like I'm buildin' pyramids
Peel your cap reveal your lack of flavor
Track your pager plus your celly
Piss on your Pele Pele, catch you comin' out of belly
Dumbin' out daily, tell me, what was your rationale?
Think of matchin' Del? I disconnect your Pactell
My mobile code words, showboat with no hope
For any rhyme you kick or any beat you load up
Leave you catatonic off a bag of chronic, scan less with anthems
Stomp your little cadence out at random
Ran-random, ran-random
El and Del-aphonic known to go off on a tantrum
Now you know
For the backpackers, for the computer hackers
For the misplaced famous, for all the video gamers
For the deranged krylon stain makers
For the ungry hungry ass verbal brain rapists

In a hovercraft, not no bubble-bath, turbo-boost
Fuck Earth, I want to live on Mars so I'm closer to the stars
And farther away from dumb civilization with no mental stimulation

Exterminate nuisance, no one listens to what you said

With brainwashing, with propaganda about your fearless leader

Or may be bounty hunters in a land of apathy

I steal computer disk files, drink water from drains
Metal detectors check ya, with reflectors in every sector
While I drink electric nectar
No one believes inspectors and spooks
They just lecture the youth about having respect and couth
Toward the US, and you guessed it
The rest get imprisoned or incisions in their medulla
No president, we have a ruler
""You are to be inside by 9 o'clock or we will shoot ya""
Missile launchers haunt ya in your nightmares
It ain't quite fair, little tykes ain't prepared
They've got your wife naked bare in the subway
For some thug play, neo-punks with cerebral pumps
For enhanced recognition of politicians and witches
Senior citizens are disposed against their wishes
Aliens landed and said our planet wasn't worth invadin

get bruised knuckles and what you look for
bad ones
busted a few much more than two
a slew of sold ass phonies,
bust their cohonies
try,
you'll catch my Vans in your highnee
that's if my bankrupt slips though I doubt
how do you want to convert me in time
but I seize more than those candies-nothing gets by me
so play them tracks-
and you'll go out like beta max
next to Tajai cause I kicks the greater stacks.

this raggedy andy gets dandy like a lion in the meadow
while the teapot blows steam like a kettle

stepping with their moods but their flows are pornographic
and man with the vocal making the locals go insane
the regal rhyming speech substan-nance for the brain
get frisky with the phrases like you praises like a deity
the one with liberated souls
-control for infinity
got style much slimma-kids' got a body child
Hieroglyphics gonna flip the rhythm for the meanwhile
articulate my lingo as I linger in my medium of speech
and I could keep poppin cause I'm trying to teach
a smidgen of religion to the fraudulant
listen, pay attention I'm the master of this convention
kick the wigidy while ye style be stutering
just like smiley
skipping singles down your satur-dreams to bad it seems you try me
and I can make it play down into extreme conscienceness

People call me nasty: that's because I eat the cat

better dreadlock on the top of my head,
never flakky
if this was a peel then Bodasa couldn't shake me
or bake me
cause Betty Crocker's oven isn't hot enough
if you wanna spread the skins
then I got alot of stuff
got it? tough-got enough-gotta lick it twice
why step? here's a fly rep
I kept my step ladder
I had a fatter flow to be hittin on
now it's just a smidgen like a pidgeon I be shittin' on
sittin on a futon...
slip the larger roots on
I'm the type of brotha that ya have to keep ya boots on
opps-
I'm sorry cause I didn't mean to dis you
I could hook a hoe and make um blow like I was tissue
mary had a little lamb, Adam got a lot of doe
looking in my garden,
schylar got a lotta hoes
Yo-I didn't mean hoes, yo I meant women
If she got the pooh, I got the trunks: let's go swimming
dip dip dive as I'm live
moving in on the top of my jock you don't stop
here a pimp there a pimp everywhere a pimp pimp
this A-plus grades the quiz-so there it is."

I had crew when they stepped at a party
hardly even known I own a Smith & Wesson
but it's resting at home
in a shoe box
they see crews jock
so they wanna step and test the rep I got
I said 'Wait a second,
check inside my coat for a shank'
they must be imagining that I'm money in the bank
they'll get spanked
cause I'm not the nigga
I got bigga brothers waiting in the bushes
to mush kids
I talk when I wanna talk
never silence
violence erupts when I clown ya
catch a beat down ya
cause I never back away from niggas
even if you gotta pistol
I dare ya pull the trigga
but that's suicide
either you must die
or I must
so why bust me
cause I'm guilty
of being in the wrong place
at the wrong time
comin' at ya in the wrong state of mind
I'm now in a hurry
a pow when a flurry
of bullets come speeding by
I needn't die
I gotta make tracks & take back my words
I eat 'em
cause everybody knows I didn't beat 'em...

""Being in the wrong place at the wrong time""
I'm out on the town
I don't frown at people
cause they tend to get offended
and then the heat will
be on my ass

I'm standing here without a nine

lookin' for Warners
you know the Brothers
me & you
we didn't do shit
but we get hassled
because we crew & we rollin'
this is my car
it isn't stollen
I hope you catch a slug
straight in your colon
when ya walkin' the beat
I bet ya gotta sheet hangin' up in ya closet
phuck this law shit
but there is two laws to follow, you know
there is laws of the city
and there's laws of the ghetto
I go to clubs with a smile on my face
just in case niggas look & wanna whyle in the place
cause of jealousy
Del is me
only me
niggas walkin' in poppin' shit
that's who the phonies be
peep it one night
and you'll see it it's quite clear
since we all know now
that's why we're
never in the wrong place @ the wrong time!

Damn, I hate cops!
I need to bust they chops
always gettin' props for the niggas they pop
peep,
I smoke weed
get weeded
cause I need it to calm my nerves before a pig get bleeded
I got busted for less than a gram of hash
they wanna cram my ass
in the slammer
that punk po-po
bringin' back hash from Amsterdam is a no-no
I didn't know they would catch me
punk mutt fetch me
stretched me out at Customs
gotta bust 'em
I can't call it
they found it in my wallet
now Customs got me
and I just can't stall it
I wish they would leave me alone
dog lookin' at me like
feed me a bone
he might bite me
very likely
they had to strike me with a fine or time
I said fine

Go straight through your ear to the mind
Listen, just cause this man is white I won't dis him
I'll enlist him, work with the system
It's a big country, ain't nobody's flunky
Be cool, don't lose control
'Cause a fool will scold someone else before himself
There ain't no need to be hurt
Proceed to be alert, the seed is in the dirt
When you ain't got nowhere else to look
You're gonna find 'em there
And the time you shared, time together
Maybe climb together, but if it don't work out
Still don't doubt or pout, it's out in the open
Hopin' that it ain't scarin' ya, this is made in America

Don't let no one tell you what to do
You your own person
I be thirstin' for more information to deal with the nation
Be forewarned, the more informed you are
Will help you swarm the farther regions
So please begin, ask your elders
I'm sure they'll tell ya where ya came from
If ya brain's numb from wonderin'
Where did ya come from then?
Ask your moms to drop the bomb
Just remember black is black, no matter the shade
Just be glad that she gave birth to you, it might hurt ya too
But you gotta wonderful life, so take it light, yo
Racial tensions makes ya fist tense
It's a cinch when you don't get alarmed
I'm strong and mighty just politely preparin' ya

Ya need a strong foundation
When ya placin' stationed in America

2343,eye-examination,2007,del-the-funky-homosapien,Hip-Hop,"I never had real friends 'til now
I never had to steal endz, 'cause that's foul
I walk the streets with the baseball bat feelin' secure
But I try not to incite fights that's immature
Actions that come back to haunt
I work hard to get the things that I want, and never flaunt
Never post where the most guys post high
I keep my focus towards the ground, and pound
Any brother who's my ace to my face
Even if snakes on the unda', I try not to wonda'
Trainin' my brain wit' mental anguish
Strange, it's rather eerie, clearly just a whim
I adjust the hymn
Deal with the dealers and the squealers and the jockeys
I can take the fizz out the carbonated copy
Imprints are made in the sand as I walk
Dim hints reveal rather grand as I talk
Small individuals seem larger
When they take charge of their antics
Makin' them gigantic
So you never suspect their neck bein' strained
So many situated thoughts in the brain
Heavy weight gain, so I weight train
'Cause to me the weight gain is a great gain
And I hate sane individuals
Close they nose to new aromas
I got the smellin' salts that are prone ta'
Clear the nasal, daze
You'll probably make a raise to a new level
And see the true devil
Any color ya wish because the devil takes any shape
Any form, any swarm
Ride over your dish like a picnic
I think the sick shit, I had my wrist slit
Like a suicide, but I survived and you can too
Plan to live a full life free of anxieties
While you're at it try to keep an eye on me
The man with meditation skills wastin' spills
Lyrical liquid, fillin' streams wit' dreams
And I will cream whoever seems wicked
Oral floral arrangements is strange since
You don't have the comprehension
I will stop and lynch them
I'm not the one promotin' gun totin'
'Cause I contain within my brain these computations
Just as potent
The mental torturer, of course
You will acknowledge me
'Cause Mr. Twister places pictures
Mental fixtures of photography
Shitty little bitties never get their clitties done
But I don't think they'll resist
Mr. Twister when I flex my verbal techs
Exit mental anorexic
I don't cater to the imbecile, so you can bet this
Is a brain buster, pain thruster, strain twister
Overwhelming pressure between the temples
When I touch the microphone, I might condone
The usage of abuse if it is convenient
I slant and lean it
Like a lever when I leave ya mutilated
By my enuciated cleaver
I survived the ither and the either
Now let me take a breather
From my own little world, little girls, little boys
Stay free of hurries, free of worries
That's riddle poised for posterity
Where are we, goin' from here
As a ho, and I don't know
And that's the biggest fear
When I'm flippin' into darkness
Now I'm askin' can I spark this?

Yo, I just won 10 grand in the Galactic
Rhyme Federation Championship, so I'm lampin' a bit
I feel like returnin' to Earth and burnin' some herb
I'm sick of lookin' at the inside of space stations
Time for Deltron to take a vacation
My expertise in aviation got us to our destination
The East Bay, my livin' quarters is completely froze solid
I thaw it out with a heat ray
Now I'm chillin' in a sauna, pulsatin' jet streams
Peepin' out in virtual reality my wet dreams
Perusin' my 21st century classic comics
The fun is astronomic
I figured since I'm here I'll renew my galactic passport
So I'm not persecuted by no galactic assholes
Schemers on the ave with their holographic hat tricks
Usin' magnetism to pick-pocket citizens
Tourists walk around with memory apprehension glasses
They attempt to capture the past tense
Virtual junkies, burnt out and lost
War veterans still trapped in the Holocaust
Yes, I know all the answers
Livin' in my true love's arms
I'm sittin' on the porch readin' Cosmopolitan
Peepin' all these dumb hoes with enhanced collagen
I'm calling in sick today, big mistake
This resulted in a final pay check and pink slip to say
Replaced by my successor 'cause I missed my place
Knowin' that the Rhyme Federation will miss my face
Referred to as a big disgrace
Now I'm free-lance with more risk to take
Now a rhymin' merk, findin' certified androids
Hit a convention, signin' autographs for fan boys
They admire my enhanced stanzas
And how I dodge manhunts and security cameras
Avoided apprehension in sub-atomic dimensions
And even more impressive 'cause of what we livin'
A self contained environment, I suggest I'm just a minor threat
I see a thing of beauty fly as heck, standin' by her desk
Paid her my respects, I was too scared to try to step
So I deployed one of my androids with dialect
Synthesized with my voice perfectly replicated
Asked for her name, and was she married? ""No, we're separated""
Booty, hey, baby, you're lookin', you're lookin' real fine
Your behind, you got 3 booty cheeks
That's kind of unique for, for a [Incomprehensible]
What say me and you hit the hot spot over at your house?
I got a few sandwiches [Incomprehensible] would be eaten
Yo, it's cool though, you got, you got one eye
[Incomprehensible] trippin' though
Listen you, me and you, we gon' places, baby
We gon' far, go all the way to Mars, Venus
We'll go to Venus if you want to
Venus, Paris 'coz I got, haha
Yes I know all the answers
Livin' in my true love's arms

Interplanetary advisories battling for supremacy
Sounds like a good way to build up my infamy
Soon as automator sent for me
He headed over to receive
Our registration forms from the galactic embassy
Yes, may I help you? Remember me?
To escape a global panic we had to intercede
Oh, you're here for the battleforms?
Yeah, can we get them for free?
I'm afraid not, you'll have to pay the entrance fee
It was worth a try, when we first arrived on Mercury
Gravity adjustment was a must and step up contestant
Number 12 I was 13, he started bursting
Ammunition that wasn't working
His rudimentary technical abilities couldn't kill me
Knocked me for a loop but I could still breathe
He had the crowd going by appearance
Here comes the anticipated interference from his squad and gods
I bust back with an onslaught of hydrothermiclyde
To burn their third eye
Though outnumbered I come wit heat
And trigger a massive explosion to the beat
They hit me with compressed air, left my chest bare
My sonic stun gun takes 'em out by the next snare
Blowin' my mind
We won the bout
Just as the oxygen tanks were runnin' out
So we're back to the ship
Pull a map from our blip
Manipulate the cursor, recharge our essentials
Set the coordinates then flow
Through a trillion miles of space
With style and grace
Next stop, Pluto
To rock these new flows
Atmosphere, methane
Be strategic like a chess game
Leave this emcee with chest pains
I had to battle a shadow in his black light form
He dazzled me, adding three points to his score
Engulfed the microphone with darkness, added three more
The panel started to roar
I had to find the core of his power
He stretched his text, causing me to blackout
It took my gat out, I couldn't back out
It took out the sound man
I'm takin' a poundin'
I bust out an a cappella that's astoundin'
Project a unibeam through his spleen
Pulled out my x-ray cannon to disintegrate the phantom
It's night, finite cell structure ruptured
His form began to bust up into clusters
Shadowy masses spread to the greater darkness of outer space
Now I'm placed first among artists
Blowin' my mind
Blowin' my mind
Serve due, more space travel, ""Computer""
""Yes Deltron, what have you?""
""Next destination?""
""The colony of Cecilia on Arthgolano""
This is apealin', hyperspace
With mic in place
We was off
Breathin' frost in the void
Thinkin' what if we are lost
Ha, entertaining ignorant thought
Land ho
Cecilia, we entered the port
Fill out a few forms then we meet our challenger
Named Q-zar
No matter who you are, I'll handle ya
He's a real charmer
I threw on my plasteel armor
He wants to absorb all the talents I worked so hard for
A biter hardcore
I busted a few shots and opened him like a car door
He was a quadruped, four arms
He hit me with four, four arms full of bronze
I said, ""Automator play the song""
(You got it)
It was the theme
Made a slight alteration in my scheme
Set him up with a comition beam
With his double team
Leaned toward his dome piece
Seremed the back of his neck
With a cranial disruption syphon
Squeezed out his brain like juice
Like a python
Blowin' my mind"

Just stretching and yawning
Picked up my belongings
And call my crew
See what we all can do
Lets go to the mall
The one with the waterfall
And take your fathers car
Although it ain't that far
They got a whole bizarre
Of fly girls up the par
Yeah sounds like a plan
I need a new Walkman
We pass the popcorn stand
And see what we can land
In the land no less
I spot a cutie with guess
And I had on sweats
She looked unimpressed
I said dam you fine
But nothing bout her behind
I said do you have the time, to sit back and chitchat
She said no
You look like a hobo
And with that camouflage shit looking like G I Joe
I said I'm not that broke
And I can buy you a coke
She said this must be a joke
I swear it hurt till she soaked, and shook me off
Like a moth
I said what's the deal with the clothing as long as it's cloth?

Why sweat her so?
Oh fuck you guys
Lets fuck with some fries
At quick stop
Where the chicks pop, up
Lets pop at them
Nigga like a magnum
Next destination
Stop at the gas station
My heart started racing
Saw this cutie who way thin
I stalk like Jason
With no authorisation
I looked her in her face and asked how her day went
And her digits
She said what is this
It's none of your business
I'm shorter than a midget
I fidget
Shit, she asked why are you nervous
I said your curves just, amaze the glaze my eyes ova
I told ya
She said are you sober
Venomous like a cobra
Don't you know that I'm older, than you
And your crew
You do what little boys do
You couldn't deal with this
Then she sealed it with a kiss, yeah
I felt dissed, and my crew is steady laughing
Wen I turn around they act like nothing had happened
Ahhhhhhh hahahahaha
Burn Del, Burn Del
That fool got clowned again man
Shot shot down
Oh here he come, Ok we out Del.

We doing a show tonight ya might wanna check us
She said your Del I said I know
The one on vinyl
And then she hit a high note
Y'all is Hiero
And where's Pep Lover
I said he on the other, side of town
But her partner had a frown
2 out a 3's cool, it ain't bad
She must not know how to add
She tripping and things
Each finger got rings
We bout to bounce like springs
But she like where my chicken wings?
Cutie like can you sign?

So you can be on my mind
To remind

Take a little tip from the tabloid, because I know I'm not paranoid

Now you and your crew are on a mission tryin' to hawk me
But it isn't happenin' ya fraudulent foes
You used to front big time now I suppose
That everything's cool since the style of apparel you adopted
You used to make fun of but now you wanna rock it

Mista Dobalina is a serpent, don't you agree?

With jeans and a dirty white hoodie
Seems like he wouldn't be a snake or would he?
Disguises come in all sizes and shapes

They all catch the vapes, even though last year they was GQ
Took a lot of time before the D-E-L could see through
The mask, all I had to do was ask Hemperor and KwamÃ©
And my man responded they would bomb a
Fraudulent foe with the strength of Hercules
The way ya on my dick must really hurt ya knees
You need to take heed and quit being such a groupie
Ever since I did a little show in Guadeloupee
I neva saw a groupie like you
But what is funny is ya wanted to be down with my crew
But D-E-L is not down with any clowns or jesters
So I would suggest that you try to impress Uncle Fester, Dobalina

Swing and give a punch and put a fraud out to lunch
And scrunch up your rap book pages
Eat 'em like it's licorice, snatch your gold chains
Steal your gold fronts and return 'em to the caves of the motherland
And ride a rhinoceros back to the other land
So I can show a foe who is the prototype
And then go toe to toe and if the rhythm is hype
I take it on my journeys to the mystic place
So I can dis the facial value of your ballyhoo
See, my style is rather passive but I can get aggressive
Brothers get done when they try to be impressive
Cause I do not impress easily, D-E-L is eager to be
The founder of the fragrance and watch the vagrants
Scatter like rats in the sewer as we do 'em like two secret agents
In the region of the forest where the march hare dwells
I sit and write scriptures by the old wishing well
Collect all my notes and sail a boat back to Berkeley
Tribes feel my vibe cause my style is rather earthly
Some say it's whack but I ain't trying to hear it
As long as what I do contains my soul and my spirit
It's cool, I use this as a rule of thumb
I take a dip into the pool of radiance until the fool was done
Slidin' on the floor like a fat ignoramus
Ya sold 8 million but ya still don't entertain us
Cause you're fraudulent, I have no time for a jester
Go take your place beside Uncle Fester
Cause you are an uncle too, you are an Uncle Tom

It sure in the hell beats living in the ghetto
Things are peaceful and everything's settle
With a good night's snooze on a bed of rose petals
I wake up in the morning feeling happy and refreshed
Before I make my journeys I must eat and get dressed
A pair of blue jeans and a shirt with greenish hues
Greener than the grass that was caught between my shoes
When I trample through the forest with my brother CM-PX
The kinky haired nubian there with a human
My hair gets notty without the proper grooming
The whole metamorphosis resembles flowers blooming
In the shadows, deep within the trenches of the sea
Free as Leah, a head of hair like a tree
Cause I'm a love child, follow me now children
Cause I'm a love child, I love to see the children smile at my antics
Foes get frantic and nervous and panic
Even as I venture past the planet called Earth
Born from the womb of the nebula
Deeper in the meadow where my actions are irregula'
I bug out and tell my maid to take the rug out
And dust it, and proceed to throw the thugs out of the pasture
As I recline on a hippo
Write the funky speech and watch my profits seem to triple and quadruple

They all add up to one great big fuck up
They try to play suck up when they want somethin'
Then always leave a brother with nothin'
Ya think ya look better cause ya skin's a little bit lighter?
You're thinkin' you're my type like I was a typewriter?
No, ya think ya all of that and all of this
But you ain't really shit without a makeup kit
See, ya might be light but ya ugly to me
Black is beautiful, to me, that's beauty
Dark skin girls are better than light skin
Light skin girls ain't better than dark skin
I disagree homeboy
Dark skin girls are better than light skin
Light skin girls ain't better than dark skin
I disagree homeboy
Now, lets get to the problems
And see if there's a way to solve them
Problem #1, has got to be the attitude
Which is usually vain, selfish and rude
Personality, with her nose stuck up
So don't try talkin' to her or walkin' with her
To class cause it's out of the question
Cause you bein' dark is the wrong complexion
For her she wish she was light, though
I mean lighter than light, or as close to white as possible
But I fight to stay a brother
You see, green and dark skin sisters are the color
This don't apply to all the girls with light skin
Just the ones with their heads up their rear end
Cause if it did, static would occur
Dark skin cuties is what I prefer
Now, look at her, her vision is a blur
Cause contact lenses only let ya see Benzes
Plus she would fuss and cuss if I tried to talk to her
Cause I'm a man who rides the bus
I get frustrated, well, lets say I used to
Now a dark and lovely is who I give juice to
So come on, step to Del if ya with this
This is the facts, so brothers don't forget this
Dark skin girls are better than light skin
Light skin girls ain't better than dark skin
I disagree homeboy
Dark skin girls are better than light skin
Light skin girls ain't better than dark skin
I disagree homeboy
I can't understand you light skin wenches
Ya think ya all that cause ya have long extensions?
Your hair was natural now ya got played out braids
You woulda looked better with a fade
Dark skin girls are so fly, so honest, so sweet
That's the type of girl I wanna meet
Complete, not phony or a fake like you are
See, Del is bolder, I tap you on the shoulder
And say, ""Hey lighty, could you tap that sister for me?""
But you love Mr. Loveable so you'll just ignore me
So find another tip that you can hop upon
To get with me ya need some sun and some Coppertone
You'll take a white boyfriend before a black one
That's why Del has to stand and attack one
Next time you see a girl darker than you
No disrespect when you met her, cause the girl looked better than you
Dark skin girls are better than light skin
Light skin girls ain't better than dark skin
Dark skin girls are better than light skin
Light skin girls ain't better than dark skin
I disagree homeboy"
2351,cyberpunks,2007,del-the-funky-homosapien,Hip-Hop,"""It is the year 2387
Man has relieved an overcrowded Earth
By the establishment of planetary colonies
In other star systems of the milky way galaxy
The most successful of these colonies
Is on Maris, a planet so Earthlike, that many call it Earth 2""
(CHORUS)(2x)
Cyberpunks, MegaDel, ultra violences when I adjust
Future phenomenon, you need to try it once
MegaDel Cyberpunk technology such as cyberbots
Check the rhymes I concocked, private stock
While you jock I set a ultra security
For MC intelligents who wanna murder me
It's like the third degree
The way I question my sanity
I work on cybernetics as a form of vanity
To protect my circuitry I stay under the canopy
I send the special ships to finish my fantasy
To become a bionic commando, monitor scandals
Solar panels reflect, energy enters me
MC's energy in the 21st century
Soling temper release, fusable alloys like musical cowboys
Super bomb raps, capable of alien contact
With rhyme pacts, create galactic soundtracks
Profound facts to word classify invoke for several decades
By the C.I.A. or now pedal death codes on the internet
The center's flesh, I smoke a pinner of bless and can't remember next
Transmission control, you better listen to your soul
When your carbon base creatures connects with technology
Brand new species, devoid of ecology
Totally electronic they monitor and follow me
(CHORUS)
Escape the cold flu, still down with kung fu
Back then they hung you, but now they fun chew
I touch the escape key, a blue light envelopes me
Covers me with energy and sucks me in the screen
I met Tron, he said don't let out about the cyber universe
Because you the first human to discover us
Neon lasers with colorful photons
I felt like voltron my hands turned to silver
Probably woulda killed ya, I just lost my sanity
My brain was enhanced with super intelligence
Shoot the elements, we stowed with a charged beam
Victory was our theme, packed more silicon than sardines
Transformed into a plane like star screens
Cyberpunk, rockin' the mic with auto targeting
5th element, the strength of six elephants
It was miraculous the way they pashed me in
Quick with the lecture remains
Testin' my phaser, I melted some glaciers, wow this great stuff
Powered with voltage, a technofile armed with explosives
Missiles, a crystalizer
To freeze MC's and then shatter them with super bases
Around relentless pound against the ground
Like an asteroid, a metal bohemive
More than you can dream of, a morval team of
Both sides of the brain
Transmuted to my physical form to ride the train
My eyes had a neon green glow, I seen foes
Instruments self destruction, made for huntin'
(CHORUS)
Controllin' cyberspace like a girl's private place
With a chassity belt, I has to be felt
Futuristic crucifixing super diction
With computer victims, terminated through the symptoms
To virus', sophisticated and bizaare
Enthrawling, I even serve smart drinks at the bar
Bonzai, mechanical tenticles hard times
For small fry who tried to hog the mic
You saw the light, took all the stripes
Stop the spying theives
That I percieve when my optics turn lime green
In this industrial environment, there's certain requirements
The mental training that helps you see the Leviathon
I'm pilotin' a giant mecca in my private sector
My invisible forcefields of course yields
The inner sanctum, better do the interface
Master programmers create aircrafts that look like dinner plates
The Zen tribe me, mob me
I did concert on their planet for 5 G's
Space the last frontier
Another make you pass on beer, we hellucinagetics with speed

Check it out, y'all
Now let's see, Deltron Z
Art avenger, let's start the adventure
Hit ya with nerve gas, absurd blasts
Crashin' space craft, I'm bio-enhanced
Hiero advanced series, monstrous evolution
Headed, tooth and nail, scoop the trail
Super-sleuth, a new race
Mad creator, savage nature
World Wide Web, the ebb and flow
Light years from watchful eyes while my thoughts provide
Objectives to ostracize the pompous prophecies
Underground societies are hard to lead
Asteroid surfin', castor oil burpin'
The darkest side of humanity animated
The grand awakenin', plan to take it in
I demand your patronage, mobilize my battle tanks
With clusters small, NTR's to empty Mars
Many MC's cruise low Earth orbit
Easier for me to use my search warrant
Drift by a star, absorb it, and store it
Leave tourists porous, my galaxy's gorgeous
Quantum jump, I'm right at your doorstep

Positive contact
I know perfectly well what it is you're talkin' about
Positive contact
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute
Positive contact
Even if the record skips, I still rip
Now I catch more wreck with fast ignition
My last decision, pulse amplification
Terror with napalm, I want y'all to stay calm
Alien annihilation
I stay armed to the grill piece and kill beef
20 percent matter, 30 percent is energy
Assemblin' to become a living being
Evaporative radiation fades your station
I get high as aviation
Positive contact
Wait a minute
Positive contact
Reactors on
Positive contact
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute
Positive contact
Even if the record skips, I still rip
I rise like helium, you're fallin' rapidly
Trapped in apathy, while I track your speed
I'm what you call a legend, dominance with armageddon
Gives me a warm reception
Verbal war with weapons, installation
Blowin' the star dust, distance twelve parsecs
Enthuse your phalanx with my literary talents
Just a bit of balance, rip the silence
In space, all-star systems are our victims
Atomics, anonymous with ominous
Implications of information or information and entertainment
Cyber-tech dialect, you gotta earn my respect
I'm like Gamera to amateurs, hit 'em with a cannonball
And in all this confusion
The fusion of music and mind precipitates translucent illusions
Search the ruins with Automator
Hit the walls with a carbonator
Hit-or-missiles, just regenerate
The sonic soldiers allow us to demonstrate
Emergency dispatch, skyscrapers ripped back
From the impact, their flow is mismatched
My style's protected by heat shields and ceramics
Don't panic, I landed on planet Mercury
Gave it atmosphere, set up my headquarters
I'll never get captured here
Rap your tear, clap your ear with Soulsonic Mantronik phonics
Turn your brain to an omelet
I'll hold a comet in bondage with my dominance
Take a space shuttle to escape trouble
Bounce through the Milky Way
Not many MC's feel this way
Positive contact
Wait a minute
Positive contact
Yeah, yeah, what is it now?
Positive contact
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute

Strong enough to cause blackouts in every single metropolis

A lot of hackers tried viruses before
Vaporize your text like so much white out
I want it where a file replication is a chore

Burn 'em all slaves to silicon
Corrupt politicians with leaders and their keywords
F.B.I and spies stealin' bombs
Decapitate their plans in their face and catch the fever
Everybody loot the stores, get your caned goods
Even space stations are having a hard time
Peacekeepers seek to take our manhood
Which results in the form of global apartheid
Ghettos are trash dumps with gas pumps
Exploding and burnt out since before the great union
The last punks walk around like masked monks
Ready to manipulate the data base or break through 'em
Human rights come in a hundredth place
Mass production has always been number one
New Earth has become a repugnant place
So it's time to spread the fear to thunder some
For long have we tried
To extend our glorious empire out to the stars
Only to be driven back
Reach the stars

The hands don't stop when the cuckoo leave the clock
There's nothing harder to stop than that who's time has come to pass
Del the Funky Homosapien says
On behalf of my behind I feel it is my duty to my booty
That I come in ahead of the class when it comes to butts
Old mother hubbard went to the cupboard to give the poor dog a bone
But when she bent over, Rover drove her, the dog had a bone of his own
He did the loose booty
Del the Funky Homosapien, yeah he's nasty, he's nasty
I've returned from the meadow with a fellow named X
Two turntables and a spark upon his set
Wet behind the ears from the tears of my peers
Rap is outta control that's what we fear
So we collapse any actual threats
With the new batch of catchy little quirks
And it works like a charm as I bomb and alarm any listeners
Coming through crisper on your transistors
So we can eliminate the frauds
Filled with pride as the audience applauds
Might sound odd to the average Joe Shmoe
The new school passed ya ass like Flo Jo, dodo

The longer the hair, the easier to scare a foe
It grows from my head until it covers up my face
People look and stare when I walk into the place
This is just a taste from the Funky Human Being
Ain't no misbehavin', ain't no use for ravin'
Surrounded by the people who would stab me in the back
My skin is really brown even though it's labeled black
Sometimes I wear a cap, and sometimes I wear bandanas
Forbidden in L.A. but I wore one in Atlanta
I chiseled up a sculpture to complement my culture
Thoughts of silly Nubians is prone to give me ulcers
Hangin' with the brothers who are tribal in their ways
For this is how I like to spend my days, and it pays
To steal a groovy sample form the archives
Use my mental staff to eliminate apartheid
Still gather papes like my man Malcom Forbes
Ponderin' my life as I look into my orbs
""Ahonetwo, ahonetwo, I like it""
I love the shade of green like my brother Billy Bixby
I utilize a sample that I salvaged from the 60's cause I'm picky
My meal must appeal to me like Morris
Far too many fraudulent opponents in the forest
I fall into the Gap when I need to purchase clothes
Easy on the fads cause the posers always pose
I suppose they will bite, they'll try not to show it
I came very plain and then feelin' rather loaded
I ditched all the beads cause my needs seem to differ

He will use his clippers to give himself a fade
I give my fro a sheen with a smidgen of Pomade

With a rhythm and a rhyme and he said that it's a twist
From the ordinary everyday continual assumption that RnB and rap makes a winner
Guess who's comin' through for dinner
A native-like brother with the passive little style
That most certainly will smother
Suicidal rhymes with apocalyptic tunes
I will drink a seltzer while you dabble with the booze
And giggle when I see ya liver shrivel to a prune

Del the black man, African back again
Crackin windshields, so I can heal your souls
When you feel my flows
A wild beast when I piece together beats like puzzles
MCs feel muzzled like dobermans
Its over when you try duplicate
And then your tooth'll ache for tryin to sink your teeth in
Meetin your maker, Del the caretaker here break your life
Away from you faker the Tammy Faye Baker
I shake your brain up like Quaker Oats
For tryin to memorize my maniacal quotes
The funk coats your eardrums, Oaklands where we're from
The deviant, workin feverishly but easily
Eagerly awaiting your arrival
Hide all you cowards
You're powerless I'm live and in technicolor and tumorous
Your humorous, my rhymes are numerous
I'm too elaborate in my habitat
With words that hit your skull like a battle ax, imagine that
I'm actually destined cause I'm acutal perfection
Equals natural selection with rhymes as my secret weapon
This involvement in my newest installment
Is dissolved in the chains on your brains like solvent
I can't call it, all it means is my genes
Comes from supreme beings, ancestors ya can't step ta
No way out come right in, writin incredible shit
They can't meddle with us
Future development is too intelligent
Future development, too too intelligent
No way out come right in, writin incredible shit
You can't meddle with us
""And you say it, And niggaz are still frontin with that
old technology shit, why is this soundin garbage?""
To many fans and not enough artists
Niggaz frontin heartless like they packin ultra cartriges
You ain't gonna smoke me, you smoke weed
I've seen some sick characters and they ain't scared a ya
The true soldiers who will unload on your intersect
Not me I'm into Tex and Mex
Giant robos and ponos, and road shows
I like to blow dough on the latest, not the status quo though
More pull than yo-yo duncan
Puttin passion in my rappin like a tongue kiss and right on by the hundreds
With no bass the foundation crumbles
Like niggaz bumble they whole life over rumbles
Scandals, sure you got hand skills
But unless you gonna be a boxer who's gonna offer
Your hand scrill? (Nobody) I used to program computers
Now I make manuvers on the mic to screw ya
On the ole, how it goes how the flow for the uninitiated
Plus on the side, get my own life sitiated
You know writin lyrics in between lines
Play some Samauri Spirits, oops
Drop funky like defecation, poop
Leavin ya mute moose, speechless
Niggaz blackin out like an eclipse
No defense for your pretense
Which is just a feat to proposal
Towards your disposal
Del flow solo, fully mobilized the wise words
So niggaz can get the total
Perception, perfection destined for greatness
Etched in your consciousness, metaphorically monstrous
No way out come right in, writin incredible shit
They can't meddle with us
Future development is too intelligent
Future development, too too intelligent
No way out come right in, writin incredible shit
You can't meddle with us
Future development is too intelligent

Trade 'em for a pair Girbauds
Never make friends with the fraudulent foes

Skinny from the many that try to eat plenty

Quench your thirst with
A swig of grapefruit juice straight from the thermos
Hock your jewels, and you can drop your tools
And make a move that can turn us in the right direction
Show your affection as I correct men
Who try to pull the wool over the third eye

As I greet the many people that I meet with a ""hello""

For five bucks for hourly intervals
I get a G for that

We cultivated the lost art of study and I brought a buddy

Copycats finish last in the human race
Staying glued to safes too prude to take a buddha break
We got espers that let us bless with fresh shit
Undetected by yes men questing for five fleeting nanoseconds of fame
Protecting the brain from conspiracies against my cosmos
While I float to Neo-Tokyo with Opio
or discuss combusitible rust clusters with Plus
Evade cyber police in a computer crib confuse the kids
but I can make a kickin rhymes thats sacred
Telepathic mind that takes its greatness from the Matrix
Esper rhyme professor rushes in ultra pressures
with correction measures
Why half the world's a desert
Cannibals eat human brains for dessert
Buried under deap dirt, mobility innert

moving at the speed of light

Sample so I can dismantle your cranium
Play me dumb if you want imbecile

like a grain of sand
in an hour glass when its filled
to capacity Cassidy
Hop-a-long to the song that is strong
I'm the massive bee
with a twelve foot stinger and I wring you're little wet towel
Cause I'm getting foul when I'm meddled with
I settle this

when you know you will fail
Slow snail as I salt ya

Broke ya skeletin ya fail again

You can pick the time and the place
So you can get a taste of medecin for your medulla cause I school a
Ferris Beulla cuttin class cause your style is butt 'n' ass;
I pass one to A+
And I say hush child
cause your plush style
Is unstable as a slush pile
You ain't down with the program
You snow man
Me the Homosapien is funky like your toe jam
So damn enlightenin I'm frightenin allota men
Open up your shutters let the sunshine in
Simple Simon rhymin' on the airwaves
So scare slays to the rhythm
So I give 'em more than a fair trade
Verbal blades
Slice humans
To ribbons cause they're fibbin' so you'll be assumin'
That I'm the dopest
I focus on the vibes that I conjure
Clean up the stains in your brain when I launder
Now feast upon
the thoughts like a mental plum
Maybe you might learn something before I'm done
Spit out the pits and hit the flows in the nose
Del lets your sub-conscious be exposed
Where it like a bullet proof vest upon your chest
Even the best hollow tip bullet couldn't make an impression
Cause this lesson
Is invulnerable
Never dwell on the hellish aspects
Have fun until you perish
Cherish your lifetime
This is why I write rhymes
To illuminate the ones with the tight minds
Sign on the dotted line
Spottin fine shelter
Step to me wrong and I'ma belt ya
Eye for an Eye
But you're eye shouldn't cry over spilled milk
Feel guilt when you know you're wrong
Never sing the song like you know it better than anyone else's
Cause that's selfish
Learn to admit mistakes
Just sit and takes a load off your back
Don't this acoustic bass on this track
Pack a wallop
All up in your face cause I'm the bold kid
Check out the illogical styles that I molded
Silly-putty syllables
That still will pull uplifting
The masses the higher plateaus of hip-hop listening

Two ton mic, leave you tongue-tied
Runnin' amuck with technology with no apology
Shoutin' out to my colony with third eye physiology
Millennium past apocalypse is all I spit
Make you swallow it, your weak style, I'll abolish it
With nuclear rockets, they glued to your optics with sci-fi
Unsettlin' man and metal blends
Underground chillin' with the Mole Man and his whole fam
Inhibit bacterial growth, material wrote
Impenetrable, incontestable, indigestible intelligence
Never let a computer tell me shit
It's rapid innovation, penetratin'
Artificial life forms who bite songs
I'ma buy a vest, lies next, then I'll flip the biotechs
Right into the wireless, your third eye is hit with psoriasis
The mightiest Deltron Zero
Traverse and purge the travesties that tempt your ear holes
The area of distribution, lifts the clueless
My flow is like, liquid oxygen
Rip it often with specific impulse, increasin' thrust
Grease the cuts, unleash a cluster of thoughts I muster
I talk to touch ya and rupture commercial communications
Convert solar energy into imagery
In the mind's eye, blindside the contagious
With radioactive isotopes to decay them
Atomic mass, they small as fragments
I magnetize the avid lies
My radiation shields reflects, rejects Decepticons
Who take the truth and stretch it long while I bless a song

Interact with tunes in my digital citadel
Critical pivotal with the mental shit on you
Spit infinity, hidden energies too dope for our planet
Star spannin', slammin' hymns
With mechanical limbs, scannin' your lens
With cosmic rays, you'll all get played, your brain's inferior
I hit the lateral and posterior
My science is eerier
Ionic bondin' for your moronic ponderin', meet the armorines
My micro machines, might throw your team into paralysis
They not talented, just a malady
Worry 'bout a salary, creative casualty
Couldn't defrag my power density intensity
Nonequivalence, nine hundred newtons
Crush you like crotons, you plus Houston
Hiero's like dipoles inside a silo
Turbulence ten-fold, never simple
Defies accepted methods, development most unique
Paralyze central nervous when you close to me
Interstellar void fills with color, appears to bubble
And split into four like amoeba
Inhabitin' planets with grandiose boast
And coast like Silver Surfer, feel the purpose

Mashin rappers with a passion
When I get Tip and Tribe flashion lyrics
I smash your spirits

The pipsqueaks get tweaked

So if you wanna measure up
then press your luck
Cause when I'm in the cut
Man there ain't no catchin up
I bet ya never heard a nigga with a bigga this flow
Bigga this bro

But can you grab the mic and kick ill shit? (like)
Stun'em with the verbs, instead of using clips.

Getting bigger, getting niggaz in headlocks

and his brother fuck a jock, and his sister, got blisters

Everybody wants to be an MC
In the year three thousand and thirty
Everybody want to be a DJ
In the year three thousand and thirty
Everybody want to be a producer
In the year three thousand and thirty
Everybody want to tell ya the meaning of the music
I must appeal to you people with your faculties
'Coz everybody else is gonna laugh at me
People try to get over and take a crack at me
The universe is one and I can see what rap can be glorious
Put in the Smithsonian, my podiums for holy hymns
But you see who's controlling them
Fuck myself off 'coz of the egotistical mode I'm in
No, I can't slap you no five
When you and your cutty is talkin' shit about me outside
People take pride in what they have no hand in
Sorta like a phantom holographic handsome
But deep inside he wants to do what his man done
Just because his peers jeer and and clown
When your six foot deep no one hears you now
They say we're not compatible like deers and cows and owls
So many rules and regulations say you're not allowed
I'm caught in the grip of the city madness
I'm caught in the grip of the city madness
I'm caught in the grip of the city madness
I'm caught in the grip of the city madness
If I had to describe the way I survive, it's like vice squeezin'
The reason I'm black and still breathin'
Heathens will breed heathens so
Everybody's suspect I must check your ID
'Coz you lookin' sheisty, you might be intelligence
Someone that Del's against, opposite or positive
When I drop the law against nature be faithful
Why should I hate you, we ain't that different?
We may act different in some ways
But we still grouped together like a fuckin' survey
Sufferin' and fuck 'em all's the motto
I'm trapped in a bottle, my music's gettin' hollow
That's what happens when humanity you follow
Where every leak or info is hard to swallow
Sell your Marlboro's and car insurance
Put niggas on the moon and can't pay your burdens
I smoke herb and rock a turban
Meditate on the world and what's occurrin'
A lot of white boys like the style and copy
Dig in something deeper and you'll peep that we're not free
It's not about the separation, it's about the population
I'm caught in the grip of the city madness
I'm caught in the grip of the city madness
I'm caught in the grip of the city madness
I'm caught in the grip of the city madness
Simple minded people always point the finger
To bring it to a close as if life is their role, their path
When all paths are intersections
It all depends on the persons perception
When I'm mad as fuck you get shot
And to some it's bad luck
I believe you held something back for too long
It grew strong
And energy got its own will
And people think they make music still
But music is there without you or me, we just manipulate
For better or worse, so let it situate
I get to make records and dough
Paid out the asshole
And still seen as another face on the totem pole
Conquer, my sponsors are monsters
And everybody thinks that I owe them one
I'm glad I love music and life
'Coz it's easy to see the pain and strife and end it all tonight
I'm caught in the grip of the city madness
I'm caught in the grip of the city madness
I'm caught in the grip of the city madness

Walking 'round oblivious more than annoying
Everywhere I turn a black life is destroyed

Listen more then once you'll need several inspections
I'm sicker than a beef recall, reiterate the fact with flows that free fall
Reintroduction the classic material, that last with imperial
Props and Pop Will Eat Itself
Hotter than coals tread and your feet'll melt

I have compassion while other brothers askin' for trouble
Brain damage got 'em befuddle
Yo, while I'm on stage pumpin' fear
Your over there in the corner drinking non alcoholic beer
Dominating, commentating moving on to great things
Embracing the lunacy, lacing the community
With one, two, and three for all clueless emcees
They need guidance, tutorials from the Overlord of skill
Magnifying music with my magnificent mind
That blinds with such shine it's embarrassing
Hop in the caravan with Hiero and hit the road to take care of fans
You know what, I'm claimin' dozens, it's Sudden Impact Crib Death
It's big threat major counter-act like tazers
Trailblazers, we clown the name sayers
I crave flavorings with custom tailorings
I can communicate with aliens, it's a daily routine

Perfectly with the tunes, I hope it hits you soon

Make a cut to the place
Where I get to see that gory face
Add a helicopter noise add some freaky lookin' boys
Get it runnin' drag me in and put the spittle on my chin
Girlfriends makin' out in prison cells
Hunchback creep and he's bangin' on the bells
Big black dog sittin' at my door
Automatic thrill and I want it some more
Add a helicopter noise add some freaky lookin' boys
Get it runnin' drag me in and put the spittle on my chin
Got me runnin' down an alley, full of hate and melancholy
Got me suckin' on a bitter pill, sucker for the big kill
Automatic thrill, got me suckin' on the pill
Automatic thrill, got me suckin' on the pill
Automatic thrill, got me suckin' on the pill
Automatic thrill, got me suckin' on the pill"

Looking at a shadow from my long gone past

I see a man that I swore I never talk to again

And in the cold dark winter days
In the clear hours of the early morning
And in the late night drunken haze
I keep on seeing things in the corner of my eye
Like this guy in an old baggy T-shirt
Smiling like he grasped something that
That the rest of us didn't understand
The way he will stand completely still
While the people just walk on by
The girl on a bike, probably on her way home
The girl in a car talking on her phone
The phone girl does not see the bike girl and hits her
And the bike girl makes a sickening sound
As she hits the street and the people scream
And the sad man is standing
Slack jawed in line for potato, sifting through his pockets
Coming up old bus tickets and grocery store receipts
Droopy eyes and baggy black jeans
It's his first time in Oslo
A pretty boy on one of those cruiser bikes
Is checking his bed head hairdo in window
While he talks to beautiful girl
It's something about the wine and Portugal
And the wild man is blocking the way
Of a businessman doing his spasmodic dance
As he screams, Take a dump in my head
Take a dump in my head
We all come home to empty beds
It doesn't matter if anyone's there or not
And we all come home to chock full heads
It doesn't matter what we do or what we got
We all come home to that silent voice
That keeps on talking
And we try to cancel it out
But it keeps on going
Keeps on going like a drone

But now I am good at killing time

As I loved the intense light, on the other side of you
Had a good look
At the course of times we knew
Are making you old when you try and forget then

When you were gone I stayed on with this hole inside of me
Watching the house from the sea
When he met with his memories he didn't know their names
You never called

A city was dark from the death of his fire

Of his soul, of his soul

Singing you a dream

It ain't no good to you
You'll make a substitute
That lets you fly away
You silence every love
Yet you always starve for more
You're only wasting time

You're a celestial tremor
Surfin' on the fast-track

Dancing on a landmine
Designed just for you
The mess you're in, oh heaven
No stranger to fear
It won't disappear
Truth never fades away
These thoughts are me
And what do you think they'll do?
The ground is a pendulum
The continent is gravel
Humming in your shoe
A pendulum
And who decides for us
At the very end of trust
The undertow of love
We only turn away"

Shield maidens ride the wolves in the sky with ravens
Scouting the battleground for souls of slain heroes
Choosers of slain
Valkyries ride through the night sky
Singing fierce battle-cries
Valkyries, choosers of slain
Come ride their wolves
Howling wolves in the night carrying female deities
Escort the dead warriors to Odin's hall

Shading a strange light, the northern lights

I'm lying in my bedroom restless at nights
And feeling someone's lying next to my side
I hear a heavy breathing - someone's next to me
And watching me
Sweet dreams now come to me
Your flesh is weak
I sense and know it's presence yet I'm asleep
Someone is preying upon my sleeping mind
Whispering
Calling, desiring
And squeezing with all its might
It's trying to take over and choke me
A nightmare seizes in a freezing grip
I feel cold fingers running taking a grip
This spirit lurking in my sleep
And giving in I'll sleep forever more
Sweet dreams now come to me
Your flesh is weak
I sense and know it's presence yet I'm asleep
Someone is preying upon my sleeping mind
Whispering
Calling, desiring
And squeezing with all its might
It's trying to take over and choke me
""The flesh is weak
Walk in the spirit
And ye shall not fulfill
The lust of the flesh""

If you just let them hide their tears

Darkest whirlpool let me pass
Stream of sorrow wide and narrow
Let this sad soul pass your halls
Shallow waters eating brothers
Darkest whirlpool let me pass
Stream of sorrow wide and narrow
Let this sad soul pass your hollow halls
In wells' abysses he dwelled in dark and deep
In the kingdom of Ahti he's the knight of eels
Reclaiming from the stream my brother and my kin
I'm reaching the great blackness that him binds
See how your brothers lay in waters
If you just let them hide their tears

How can I pretend to know my own mind?

I'm lost at home, out of time
The coins I flip land on their side
I'm holding my breath at your end of town
I'm just passing by, not for the first time
If I could rest my head just for a moment
Then I think that I would be fine
Slowly sinking, still thinking
There must be something I am missing
The streetlight, my sunlight
I won't sleep, I'm up all night
Can't stop till I have been used up
If I was not lost for words
Then I'd have nothing to describe

Thou give me fever
When we kisseth
A fever with the flaming youth
Fever I'm on fire
Fever yeah, I burn forsooth
Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said Daddy, oh don't you dare
He gives me fever
With his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever
I'm his Mrs.
And Daddy won't you treat him right
Now that you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give ya fever
Be it fahrenheit or centigrade
They give ya fever
When ya kiss em
Fever if you live ya learn
Fever until you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn

All down the front of my favorite satin shirt.

And the children grow

When I caught you there
In tomorrows mirror

Jump out of my skin
Throwing oil into

Filling empty footsteps
I was standing in

The same as you will too
I wanted to live forever
And everybody knew
As the falling rain
Of the northern jungle
Hanging droplets on the leaves
Bombards my brain
I hear you
Across the room
A sea of daffodils spring into bloom
You are the mist
The frost across my window pane
And again
She moves her body
And her whispers weave
And the world spins
And tells me that I'll never want to leave

Like having a black sun in a white world.
I have a son,
His name is Eden.
It's his birthright,
Beyond estranged time.
Give me 69 years,
Another season in this hell.
It's all sex and death
as far as I can tell.
Like Prometheus we are bound,
Chained to this rock
of a brave new world,
Our godforsaken lot.
And I feel
that's all we've ever needed to know,
'Til worlds end and the seas run cold.
Give me 69 years,
Another season in this hell.
There is sex and death
In mother nature's plans.
Like Prometheus we are bound,
Chained to this rock of a brave new world,
Our godforsaken lot."
2741,reality-clash,2007,antimatter,Rock,"Resist, you never could, you never will
Bare my soul for a moment of delusion
Blame it on the past catching up
To take the glory without substance
Selling someone else's soul
To take you further falling deeper into false
Stealing heroes, you don't realize the shit you're in
For once it's come around again
So exercise your right to run, your right to ruin
Breaking away from broken days of shame
Illusions playing the game
Validate a life of lies
So high on manufactured pride
Faking away, making waves to gaze
Reality astray, delusion paved the way
While we made it to the other side
You lost your pride and your alibis"

Trying to forget tomorrow and all that's happened

I feel, I'm seeing so clear
I thought I was never going to die
I feel, I'm seeing so clear
We need more time
Slipping away, I think I'm gonna crack
Misplaced trust, loyalty stabbed in the gut

And now I'm coming back..."

All these conditions will keep you from dying as long as you're looking over your shoulder.
Stay aware of echoes in the moonlight careful not to call.
Don't engage in any kind of dreaming, conscious through it all.
If in doubt find space beside a river, careful not to drown.

Immersed in light, broken in flight,
Here comes that scene again,
Not another sleepless night.
Scripted yet stuck on every line,
Upon my face a look of pure surprise,
I thought I'd be fighting fire.
How it's changed from my dream,
Did I stray from the path laid out for me?
How it's changed,
Did I fail in some way?
Easy to plot a course divine,
A simple graph can't cover ever line,
and I don't see what I don't know.
Some truths are harder to perceive,
The color has been drained now from my eyes,
Staring into endless time..."

But I had twenty six drinks and the chicken was dope
And when the van broke down, yo, the crew had hope
So I'll be leaving this room with some pillows and soap
'Cause I've been living out a suitcase since eight years old
Doin' my thang with the gang till we hittin' the road
Turning a hotel room to my humble abode
Till I stumble up to the check out wearing blankets for clothes
Now let's do this like it's never been done
And play grooves at night for everyone
There's no rules 'cause this ain't never been done

Wow, I seen you on my Facebook profile
Sending me a message and then offerin' the smiles out
How's your dad doing, still rakin' in that dough huh?
You're suppose to laugh that's a joke hun
I like to poke fun, so don't take it to the heart
Last time I heard you was in school studying art
So what, you dropped out and now your work in the bar
But I thought you had it made a big house and a car
I'ma try to get paid for what I say on stage
But if you're already paid then I guess you got it made
You're a rich girl and it's gone too far

You can rely on the old man's money

I'm on the road trying to make my way okay!
Cause going at the clubs ain't cheap
And neither are the clothes on your back
Or the shoes on your feet girl
Your daddy got the dough that's right
His people he be breakin you off yeah off
In her world a boat's, a yacht, a king size bed's a cot
A millions not a lot
I'm just trying to get paid for what I say on stage

I saw the writing on the wall
Dad's money's gonna back it up girlfriend
Dad's money just to back it up girl
I saw you headed for a fall
I was the one who made the call
Dad's money's gonna back it up girlfriend

Washing over me I'm frozen stuck in time.
And I swear, I never seen the likes of you before.
And I promise this ain't difficult, doesn't happen every night.
My heart's racing, trying to catch up to you,
The light that you let off is gold.
I can't shake this feeling it fills the room,
These chills didn't come from the cold,
They came from you.
They came from you.
My world came crashing down right under you,
These chills didn't come from the cold,
They came from you.
See I was doing my own thing 'till you came across my path,
Made me feel like singing, but usually I rap.
But how can I explain the things you do to me,
I'm acting all the proper words and phrases,
Hold up lemme get back to that,
Because I'm awe struck, star struck,
Turned around from my hard luck
Let you know that from bar one,
You are the one and that's bar none,
I'll try the best to control myself,
At least that's what I told myself,
But inside I just bought a farm,
You're the one that just sold that house,
Got my heart in that headlock,
I'mm hosing on and you hold the belt,
I mean this in the best way when I tell you that you're cold as hell
That makes no sense, but neither does this feeling,
I know that my time is short, but next to you, I touch the ceiling.
My heart's racing, trying to catch up to you,
The light that you let off is gold.
I can't shake this feeling it fills the room,
These chills didn't come from the cold.
They came from you.
They came from you.
My world came crashing down right under you,
These chills didn't come from the cold,
They came from you."

'Cause I'm [incomprehensible] than a couch potato
With a purple napsack full of alligator
Get up like an elevator
I got the flavour behavior becoming over your friendly neighbourhood town
Flier than a helipad, or a pelican
Or dem crazy cartoon pink floatin' elephants
'Round here, act your age, less intelligent
You smeared out, lost your job, up your gentlemen
Kick it to the wood, I'll show you her town bar
Kick it to the crib, we call it the Town Hall
Sons of bitches tryin' to get into Town's draws
If she lucky, she gonna go down on town's

And I know that the ponies like carrots
But the kid's so nice, I don't even gotta wear it
Sub's just blaring, so she hop up in the carriage
Roll it up then share it until we spin like fairies
Girl, move to the hip hop, hip and [incomprehensible]
It's the bitch with the flip-flops, check the wristwatch
It's about that time to Ddub design
S to the L'low, make you shake like Jello
Yeah, my first name (Cam?), and I'm doing the damn thing
You grabbin' the wang-tang, we playing the bang game
Gets much brains, they call it the crane bang
And I'm sorry if you're lost, you know that my slang change
Me and your man, we not in the same lane
I come from the same cloth, we ain't in the same vein
On the next level, we still on the same plane
I'm always switchin' it up while he doing the same thing

It's taking over my brain, it's taking over control
There's no use in fighting, I'm feeling like a titan
This shit is so electric man
I should be throwing lightening
So count me out of your life
And take it to the bank
And put your arms up if you're down to join the ranks
But then again you can't lose if you don't play
You can't wear out your welcome if you don't stay
So I'm going out to get it and I won't wait
Hands in the air if you get it in your own way
Tonight we surrender
And leave here forever
White flags in the air
Wave 'em like you just don't care
Tonight we surrender
And leave here forever
White flags in the air
Wave 'em like you just don't care
Wave 'em like you just don't care
Wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you feel like you're going nowhere
Then wave 'em like you just don't care
Cause tonight we surrender
Wave 'em like you just don't care
Tonight we surrender
And leave here forever
White flags in the air
Wave 'em like you just don't care
Tonight we surrender
And leave here forever
White flags in the air
Wave 'em like you just don't care
Wave 'em, wave 'em, eh, oh
Wave 'em like you just don't care
Wave 'em, wave 'em, eh, oh
Wave 'em like you just don't care
Wave 'em, wave 'em, eh, oh
Wave 'em like you just don't care

As soon as I saw your bestfriend there in the entrence I knew you were destined.
And we made friends but shared the rest if you wear the pants she wears the dresses.
I'm not sexist, just obsessive.I've been watchin' her.I confess that I sent her a message, couple of X'es,funny how a text can turn to breakfast.Ha, and thats how we got right here, too many lights, strobe lights and light beer, me and her just kicked into high gear.Thats Weird, despite what ya might hear.
You want romance, but I don't slow dance,and I won't hold hands,so there is no chance. Anyways,

Let's get drunk now, that's the topic.
Vodka or vodka: that's your option.
Take those shots like you're pro at boxing.
You got me thinking it's on now,
Hold the choke of that bong down,
Stumbling onto your lawn now,
People say that I'm wrong now.
Calm down, it's only your grass,
So what I mooned you, it's only my ass.
Don't even ask what I'm thinking, I've been drinking, pour me a glass.

You wanna party?
Just call me! Send for me! 10-4 me!
Get 40's. Hey shorty, just take this cup and start pouring!
Don't hate with it, spring break with it.
Do some dumb shit, and say they did it.
Do some drunk shit, show some skin!
Nice to meet you, can I meet the twins? YUPP!
I like to win, I got more points than a box of pins.
Now we here, let the fun begin, and get more trash than a garbage bin!

And leave my prince for your fancy clothes
But I thought that I was the one you chose
I thought that I was the one who knows
Secrets you don't tell your friends
But it looks like the joke's on me again
Laugh it up, and watch me pretend
That the race is over and I can see the end
I know exactly what's in store
Being with you is such a chore
Used my heart to mop the floor
I know it's bad, but I still want more

Rain of the ice queen.
Snowfall, freezing.

I was treading water,
Now I'm frozen in the deep end.

Coming at me sideways.
Used to have my back,

Until hell froze over.

This is no duet,
Cause me and you could never sound right
My business is booming now,
But I'm looking to downsize.
Every night I look at you,
And all I see are downsides.
But still your name's coming up,
And I wish I didn't give a f**k.

You're hoping that I freeze when I see your face.

Cross every province line, every state boarder
Every kid who drinks liquor
Every kid who throws up
Every kid who heard about the Webster show and showed up
But now you got to jam with us, so you're probably a fan of us
With one verse I'll let you all know exactly the plan with us
Come on stand with us
Yeah, throw up your hands with us
We're coming through your city 'cause I know you've been demanding us
They told me star maps will take you to the stars
Just because you're driven that don't mean you'll get the car
Because you're going fast that don't mean you go far

And drunk rapper, punk rock kid, DJ to track master
Girls who act proper, chicks who act nuts
Seems like the whole world wanna know about us
And you, we are rocking you, when we rocking you
Taking off like a rocket ship when we set it off
When you people taking off, in a word set it off
When you people taking off on the world
They told me star maps will take you to the stars

Well you didn't get down with us
Never cooked up a sound with us
Never stepped to the mound
So you'll hold up the crown with us

Heads in the clouds but gravity's always grounded us
I never was asleep but I always had a dream
And I never had a beeper; I'm always on the scene
Don't need to go and dig it deeper, 'cause you know just what I mean
Nobody's gonna teach you, gotta learn for the team
Now you know I'm gonna set this bitch off
I know you only hating 'cause I make you pissed off

Keep your little star maps; you know you're still lost

But that don't mean nothin' to me, at all, I want it all
I've got dreams, larger then you'd ever believe
But I don't want nothing for free, at all, I want it all
(Verse 2):
When they tell you slow down, when you goin' this crazy
Wake up and smell the roses, before you pushin' daisies
Well I'mma keep pushin' like the day my momma made me
So life is but a dream, and no one better wake me
Goin hard with it, gettin' blues, steal swagger
Like an advil, went and did it with a hammer
Rollin' like a camera, focused like some film
And I'm ready for my close-up in that Coupe De Ville
But you can have your coupe back, I'mma pontoon that
Cadermera jazz with the fan blowin' fruit back
Feelin I'mma booth that, winner on the two track
And when it's my time to rain, I monsoon that
(Chorus):
Well I've seen, exactly what you want me to be
But that don't mean nothin' to me, at all, I want it all
I've got dreams, larger then you'd ever believe
But I don't want nothing for free, at all, I want it all
(Verse 3):
I just can't wait
You bring the liquor I'm on a chase
And I'mma keep running until the race is done
And the race ain't won
But I want it so bad that I can taste this one
Go hate, I know you're only happy when it rains
But I won't be happy to play the game, I'm done
It's the same old song and the same fire burning yea the flames still strong
(Chorus):
Well I've seen, exactly what you want me to be
But that don't mean nothin' to me, at all, I want it all
I've got dreams, larger then you'd ever believe
But I don't want nothing for free, at all, I want it all

Stop staring at the sun
She's got you on the run now
Who's the smoke and gun
Boy, look at what you've done
Stop staring at the sun
The sun, stop staring at the sun

Staring at the sun

Whoa

You got me staring at you
I wanna do what you do
I wanna go where you go
I wanna fly where you flew
I wanna know what you know
I wanna know your name
You're the fortune
You're the fame
You're the fire
You're the flame
I'm a fish in a barrel, you got the shotgun
Been so cool, I want the hot sun
To beat down on me, the heat's all on me
I hear a ""woo woo"", but, uh, can't run
The reason I want that fancy car
The only reason that I'm at the bar
The reason that I hear a song that I hate
And all of a sudden I'm dancing hard
(Chorus):
She's got you on the run now
Who's the smoke and gun
Boy, look at what you've done
Stop staring at the sun
She's got you on the run now

Staring at the sun
Ohhhh, you better keep your head down low
Whoa
(Verse 2):
You're everything that I want
You're everything that I see
I like the way that you shine, I want you shining with me
But every time I get close
You keep on burning my wings
But it doesn't mean a thing
You're my pleasure, you're my pain
And I keep on looking eventhough it burns
And my whole world revolves around her
She goes off like a revolver
She got me wrapped around her trigger finger
Shot to the heart and it's her to blame
Those shots at the bar, you forget the name
If you get in the fire, you get the flames
I keep on sayin' one thing
(Verse 3):
You want the house on the hills
You ain't got time for the bills
You got the girl of your dreams
You think she's finer then real, so no
She's too hot, could you see her in youe future?
She's got a man and you're a damn common future
Your dumb mind ain't see it like you used to
Life is what you choose, but I guess it's what you're used to
Oh oh, you better keep your head down low
(Chorus):
She's got you on the run now
Who's the smoke and gun
Boy, look at what you've done
Stop staring at the sun
She's got you on the run now
Who's the smoke and gun
Boy, look at what you've done
Stop staring at the sun
The sun, stop staring at the sun
The sun, the sun, stop staring at
Staring at the sun
Ohhhh, you better keep your head down low

Sloppy, push my way to the front
Shoes are untied, the shirt's untucked
Get off the wagon, or eat my dust
Grab the coattails, or be like us
Can't be late when you don't show up
Punch the clock till the glass got stuck
In my hand now how am I supposed to chug?
Let's get lambos, fuck the bus
Say mom, I wanna be a rockstar
Ask her opinion, she'll get lock jawed
Doesn't matter though, she can't stop the
Way you're living, now fuck the cop cars
Amps on ten, let's break the knob
ODP meets Tim McGraw

Back it up girl, I wave you in
Buck's stayin' in, and I came to win
The line that I'm walking is paper thin
I shut down every single place I'm in
Professional, born to spazz
Broke a leg and then joined the cast
Can't slow down, my life's too fast
And I'm trying to get paid, first and last
Rock with me, Be cool again
Get stupid, like you need school again
I'm foolish, you can get fooled again
Jump on stage like a hooligan

You're just taking the job
Getting carried away
Until they come, carry you off
Won't slow down
But you're stopping to flirt
You got last nights decisions
All over your shirt
And you so off balance
That it's sort of a talent
I tell you not to worry

Staying at the bar like you couldn't find the exit
Feeling like a star, when you staying up till breakfast
Yeah, you working hard girl, you want some exec. shit
Stamps on the hand like references
Right this way to your section is
It's business time and you're in charge
They all want to be in your entourage
And not too long till you lose your friends
One eye closed, trying to BBM
And when the DJ play that song
She right back on her job

Let me tell you, you do it super
Clock in, clock out
Sip that bub in large amounts

The grass is greener on the other guy's lawn
But I'm on mine now, until it looks right
I'm looking at my glass and it looks half empty
I'm still gonna chug that shit tonight
Want to go places, trying to pack
But I'm stuck in my basement, trying to rap
Fell down once, but I'm climbing back
And I can see my dreams in a shiny plaque
Sometimes dreams play hard to get
You can't believe in those promises
When you offer the bread and condiments
'Cause you can't pay your bills with compliments
I know where I'm going, I just want to get there
Got a lot of shoes and I'm running in my best pair
But my mind's on the next pair
And where I'm gonna be next year

'Cause life ain't a movie though
And you didn't write the scripts
So there's no way of cheating though
But you're getting out of it
And the love is the truth, you know
The money is counterfeit
Put it all on a million, though
I'm liking the sound of it, yeah
I'm not a superhero
And that's all that I can say
'Cause when the times get tough
The tough don't fly away
It's almost over now
But back in the beginning
We had nothing to lose
It was time we started winning
Escape the underground
Sun's out, stars shine
Now that we're all stars
Just had our stars align
And you can do it too
And hold your own hand
Just keep on doing you
Follow your own plan

He says he's coming back but he keeps on leaving
He's breathing he's trying to keep his faith
But he keeps on thinking that his life's just a waste
Just another mother fucker that thinks he knows it all
But this mother fucker don't know shit at all
The smartest mother fuckers know they don't know nothing
But they're always learning trying to understand something
Just another politician that keeps on lying
Another baby gone but the mother's still crying
She's dying she just wants peace
But there's death right here and there's war in the middle east
And she really wants to know but there's nothing she can do
Cuz in the daytime there's nightmares too
The world's full of lies and schools a scam
cuz they can't fucking tell me how to live or who I am

Pick a side it's fine we watch em all fall
Pick a life take mine we watch em all fall

Pick a life take mine we watch em all fall
Watch us come and take em all

And this other mother fucker trying to call his bluff
Now these stupid mother fuckers know they can't back down
Stupid fucker number one shot the other fucker down
Just another bomb blowing up a building
We don't see all the killings of millions
They wanna lead but be careful where you follow
They shadow all their lies till there may be no tomorrow
We wanna believe that everything's fine
That our rules and our values are on the same line
And that everybody's knowing that everything is fine

Can't retort feelings cuz they're all missin
Self confliction just creates twitching
And no one is here to stop all my unhealthy traditions
Look at them look at him look at her
Look at everybody looking at me looking like a blur
And the view is all distorted when opinions start to leak
The ideas of public make my argument seem weak
Take it to the streets speak my peace and stand up
Cuz I'm not the only one here getting fucked
I'm in love with the game or the product at least
I'll never stop until I leave until quit until I
Chorus
Look at me tell me what I cannot see
It gets more blurry everyday so show me or leave me
I'll give it all to you just tell me what I can do
Don't matter what I say so take me or leave me
Can you tell me why I do the everything that I do
Why we never sell out and we always stay true
If you listen to my words then maybe you will see
Sometimes I feel like you know me better than me
I can write a track sit back and it will die
But you give it life if I'm gone it will survive
And I know what you need all that draws you in
We are all the same we all love but we all sin
And I get it and you won't
And I need it but you don't
Before you speak your mind take the time to think it out
Cuz aint a doubt what this songs about
Look at me tell me what I cannot see
It gets more blurry everyday so show me or leave me
I'll give it all to you just tell me what I can do
Don't matter what I say so take me or leave me
Yeah I get it you wanna fit in
But your life don't suffice so you gotta pretend
You're falling again I'm sorry but it's all in your head
That imaginary honor that you try to defend
You can follow the trends and try to swallow them up
Or jump the bandwagon and just follow your gut
But never the less, it's always the more
Like your car is still in park and your pedals to the floor
Now you're sitting worried flippin and blaming the dirty pistons
When you know it's blurry vision that's making you look ridiculous
Specks can't correct the vitamin A deficiency
Tell me what you see cuz the curiosity is killing me
Look at me tell me what I cannot see
It gets more blurry everyday so show me or leave me

It don't matter cuz it's all just a faze
Just another day just another way to make you say

We're never that far away
Since day one I was never fucking like you
They all criticize but never had a right to
Then never knew what it did to me

I can fake my smile I can make em believe
That I'm still a healthy person when I hide my disease
I can make em think I'm like them
I can make em think that I'm their friend

Can you see the truth or just the truth in lies
I can't take it anymore I can't help myself
Cuz when I take these pills then I'm someone else
You can't do a damn thing cuz it's up to me
Just let me be me so I can be free
Will you let them take over will you try to run and hide
Can you take off the mask from which your inside
You see me cut so deep to try to find what might be hidden

Sometimes things get clear when you're blind
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Sometimes things get clear when you're blind
Just close your eyes and I'll close mine
I can see so clear when I'm blind
Here I am on cloud nine
Living a thin line but having a great time
On top of the world with the other mother fuckers
Thinking everybody love us and there's nothing up above us
Here I am with all I can give
Everything that was what will be and now is
Take a step back and check how you live
You don't love what you got then you don't got shit
They say you don't know what you got till it's gone
And you can't back down cuz you waited too long
They know how you feel cuz you wear it on your sleeve
And you don't want to stay but you know you can't leave
So breathe take your time cuz you know how I feel
With wounds that are just too deep to even heal
Gotta close my eyes so I can finally see
Everything I am and who I wanna be
You see me cut so deep to try to find what might be hidden
You watch me rip and tear to feel what's there what all is missing

Can it open up your eyes and erase all doubt
Or will you scream and shout to your voice runs out
Your so hypnotic

I'm stuck in the cracks and I never can relax

y-y-you know I'm on now
Turn me on
I know you you'll give it to me
i-i-i'll turn you on now
Take a chance
Living on let it go, open eyes surprise yo let's role
Take a try
Living on let it fly, fine lines and time to take mine
Turn me on
I see they're watchin me
I hear them asking me
I think they're wondering what's turning me what's twisting me
It's not what you would think
It's not what you would need
It's something more I'm looking for my kind of ecstasy
I see them listening
I know they're questioning what's turning me what's twistin me
It's not what you could see
It's not what you would be
It's something more I'm looking for my own tranquility
Turn me on
You know I'm on now, you know I'm on, you know I'm on now
I see them watching me
I hear them asking me, my kind of ecstasy
Turn me on
They're questioning what's turning me what's twisting me
What you could see
What you would be
It's something more I'm looking for my own tranquility
What's turning me what's twisting me
It's not what you could see
Turn me on
It's something more I'm looking for my kind of ecstasy
My tranquility
Them listening, they're questioning what's turning me what's twisting me

2846,my-song,2010,abica,Hip-Hop,"Tell me what I got to do so I can make it alright
Tell me what I got to do so I can sleep through the night
I need a change just to get you out my head
And I feel so strange like a part of me is fucking dead
So let me be, let me breathe
I just need this to end
I don't need you, don't need them
I don't need a friend
I need a break I need some space I just need to be alone
I need to take some time so I can think all on my own
I should of known about the things you did behind my back
I saw some flaws in what you said but I didn't ask
I let it go until this day it's something I regret
The time will pass the pain will ease but I won't forget
Chorus
It once was ours but now it's all mine
I took it too far laid it all on the line
Say this is my song cuz we made it for you
Say this is my song cuz we made it for you
It once was ours but now it's all mine
I took it too far laid it all on the line
Say this is my song
This is my song!
Say this is my song
This is my song!
My brains scattered, broken flowin over hopes that I held inside
Scripted every lyric for the appearance of a selfless crime
Simplify the cadence like nursery rhymes you can follow
Kept all the receipts so you can return the time that you borrowed
I want every minute, every second of every fucking moment reimbursed
And I noticed you're feeling worse
And it's only what you deserve, I'm over getting deserted
I rolled it flipped it reversed it cuz I'm a totally different person
You told me it wasn't working I insisted you should listen
So much for being perfect now I'm cursing all your kisses
Should of ran up in your purse and boosted all your fucking lipstick
To take back every shade of all of the colors of love that I'm missing
Withdrawals are one of the symptoms of a bitch
With an addiction for a dude getting abused
Now I'm confused like who's the victim
This fairy tale won't end like it started, oh so magically
Cuz I know that she can't live happily ever after me
It once was ours but now it's all mine
I took it too far laid it all on the line
Say this is my song cuz we made it for you
Say this is my song cuz we made it for you
It once was ours but now it's all mine
I took it too far laid it all on the line
Say this is my song
This is my song!
Say this is my song
This is my song!
It's got you running, yeah, running away
It's got you flipping out when you hear it play
It's just the feeling man it brings it all back
You fucking pussy, just be a man gotta take it back, Yeah
You feel the bass line, hear the kicks and dirty synth
You aint sharing this with nobody am I making sense
This is the turn around this is that revival shit
Put it in your mother fucking throat spit it, fuck that bitch!
Ahh it feels better don't it, you get it want it
You get it grab it got it go, now go ahead and flaunt it
Cuz aint nobody gonna take this away
This is epitome of living free and it's here to stay
It once was lost in the bind that we held
Then my whole fucking world came and went to hell
It once was him and her and he and she
Wanna hear the whole world come and say it with me
It once was ours but now it's all mine
I took it too far laid it all on the line
Say this is my song cuz we made it for you
Say this is my song cuz we made it for you
It once was ours but now it's all mine
I took it too far laid it all on the line

Do you really not care
It looks like we got something to share
Why!
I know it's really not fair
You look around and there's nobody there
You know!
You know I did the work, put the time, wrote the truth to fill the lines
You know!
That I've had so much and I'm never backing down and I'm never losing touch
Oh no!
Now I know it's much better
Let the time take the rain it's the weather
Or not, did you even try
I know a lot of people talking like they do but they lie
Excuses!
Yo, fuck your reasons keep it shut just stick to breathing
These days have come and gone that's why I'm done with holding on
I've done a lot
I've said too much
I've lost my grip
Can't feel your touch
I'll take it back it was just to heavy
But for now
Chorus
We're gonna take it all
Won't beg, won't plead or crawl
We'll take you out this time
But first you tell us why
We're the underground
Our circuits built the sound
Before we say goodbye
It's time to tell me why
Don't let me stop I know, I can turn this
Now!
Now I'll turn it around, it's been the same old thing but I'm living it now
how!
Do you go when I'm bound, it's been three long years but I'm living it now
So!
You're just another lost hope, just one more proof to everything I wrote
go!
Cuz you think you know, but you don't, low with a bottle of soco
Now, tell me how to make it all ok today!
Holding me down with your fucking chains
Going out of our fucking brains
Now I'll show you why I feel this way
Like nothing right here makes sense today
So, let it in let it get inside
Let it take over and watch your past die
We're gonna take it all
Won't beg, won't plead or crawl
We'll take you out this time
But first you tell us why
We're the underground
Our circuits built the sound
You've got to tell us why
Just tell me why I thought it needed to be
What's good for you
What's good for them
What's mine is nothing to me
So I choose to not believe
No!
And not let this get to me!
No!
I don't think that you could see
What this did to me
So just let me be
Just go!
This image is so real
I just can't shake it
The truths not yours to steal
But still you take it
We're gonna take it all
Won't beg, won't plead or crawl
We'll take you out this time
But first you tell us why
We're the underground
Our circuits built the sound
You've got to tell us why"

You got some great ideas but you got no self esteem
And you try but you're stuck and no one gives a fuck but you can't give up
Trip and fall cuz no one can be perfect
Earn and learn it and then you will deserve it
I'm so fucking sick of these people being pussies
I'm so fucking sick of these people trying to push me

That's what I gotta say
Watch em fall
Till they all bleed away
Do what you gotta do get the fuck up
Cuz these fucking punks need to know when to shut the fuck up
If you wanna be down, knock a hater to the ground
Cuz these mother fuckers here are always around
Tac and hash and you know where we stand
At the very top and you know it man
I aint one to talk shit
But if you bring it up blow it up
Leave it alone or ima show you up
This is real I ain't fucking around
I represent all our fans who say they'll always be down
I gotta short fuse and you're holding a match
I fucking dare you to set it off just let it off I'll show you were I'm at

Lemme prove it just put the CD on repeat
Fuck em all

Got her locked up in my basement, maybe
I'm her only man and she's my pretty lady
I know she loves me when she screams out, save me!
Put that song on
I make her dance
She doesn't have a choice it's what I call romance
I watch her go and I'm hypnotized
And she looks so cute with tears in her eyes

One by one these days pass by
But not too many people think to ask why
Say goodbye, this can't be for nothin
Nowhere to go but you know they're hidin something
I play the game that I'm meant to fail
But the game is rigged on a larger scale
It took you so long and you got so far
Now you know you're wrong but not who you are
You try to find out but you get no where
Life's not fair you won't find it here
So, tell me are you ready to jump
To tell the whole world you don't give a fuck

Told to make friends and succeed that's not reality
Open them up, and see man, lies man cries man, don't you close your eyes man, the truth man, the Proof man, it's right where you stand man, where you stand man
All you crazy mother fuckers saying fucker you crazy
Ever since a baby
Rocking the label right from the cradle I was told a fable
I'm looking at you and your wearing a disguise
You're a product of tradition I can see it in yours
And the people will ask the questions and need the answers
Spreading like disease counter please so we can get somewhere
Who wants to live where, there's no greed where
The visions not clear where everybody's scared there
Scared of the mind controlling matter
These pessimistic ways suck don't be flattered
Built to last
You're a punk
Ya, look at them chains
Hiding in the shadows but I'm seeing everything
I'm the outlaw, better run and hide
I'm a loner fuck Bonny, just Clyde, lets ride
I think I scared em away

Now we grew and spread and the songs begun
It's like our lives have changed but we're still the same
It's like I'm stuck here can't get out of this game
And I know what it's like when you want to quit
And I know even better to ignore that shit
I don't need this right now in fact I never did
You can't keep it under wraps just subtract the lid
You're just a leech just a bug just a fucking excuse
With your hand on my shoulder while your tying my noose

You wouldn't fucking believe the time I spend on this
And everything else I pushed it all to the side
I play my music so loud it's all been buried alive
I'm talking relationships, It's part of this
I'm thinking it, it just cannot fit that's why I try to be avoiding it
The biggest mistake you make from all of this
Is mistaken how I choose to be alone thinking it's loneliness
I'm coming home
I travel alone this way

The place I used to know is not a place that I can go
No, no, to the place I used to know
The place where I'm alone is not a place that you should know
Looking back like I thought it would be easy
Like I never thought that my past would ever leave me
I gotta slow down it seems like everything's faster
I wanna take this in It's like a beautiful disaster
You can be my master as I sift through the pieces
Stuck in the plaster like the folds and the creases
I wanna do it all before I'm under the stone
Reminiscing, but I'm missin that I'm already home, come on
I'm coming home
I travel alone this way

I see you wanna know how
I can show I can lead but make sure that it's what you need

I feel it creeping slow
I feel it start to flow

Or it could feel so good like ecstasy
Or it could feel so good like ecstasy
I can feel something
I finally feel something

I'm finally real

Got a razor and a mirror, tears and a throat
Everything that's made me numb has returned
All the scars in my head turns to fire and it burns
Tell me what you got I need I'll let it come destroy me
I said it's what I needed and it is if it stops
And I said I need to feel like I'm real but I'm not
And I know it's what I needed and I hope it never stops
And I know I want to feel like I'm real but I'm not
Stop. And let me off or just let go
Is it worth being real I still don't know

As for fear of cold rejection, I've had none.
There were avant-garde composers,
Even 'dese and 'dem and 'dozers, it was fun!
But among the many faces and the whiskey breath embraces
there was one.
It was not exactly Paris. It was not exactly spring.
But it was Beaujolais and flowers, double beds and double showers,
And the passion that his kisses used to bring.
It was not exactly Paris. I was not exactly young.
But on a quiet night with the door locked tight
and the silence weighs a ton.
Of all the men in my life, I remember one.
It was not exactly Venice. Never heard a mandolin.
But it was kisses and linguini set to Mercer and Mancini.
It was boating in the park and falling in."

Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you,
Give you the break you need
More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know
Whether you're right, whether you're wrong

You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)
Loving you the way that I do

Loving may be all you can give
But baby I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry

Are you still alive inside?
Can you tell one more time?
Tell me where to run
Tell me where to hide
I'll see you where you go
I'll see you once again
Try to not be slow
For one more deadly sin
Look outside
The flames are burning
Search inside
The times are turning
Look to the dark
Your soul is running from you!
I can't wait to find
More people of my kind
They have to come quick
Before we all get sick
The lights are out
And no one can see
All that is wrong
With everything around me
(Chorus)"
2868,no-one-learned,2006,fallacy,Metal,"(J. Hall/D. Tretola)
The privilege has been given too much
To forgive and forget for all you've done
Now you have a label on yourself
To show what's next to come
You get so much out of all this
Pain and misfortune to all your surroundings
You never learned to stop your troubles
Prepare to suffer for what you've done
Stand alone, in a place
And no one speaks a word
Different from other days
Everything vanished, No one learned
Why are we waiting for the end?
I know its not coming
We should leave it all
Seeing what else it could bring
(Chorus)
-(Solo)-
Things have to come now for you
Add all this pain to all this sorrow
You've got what you want now
But you'll definitely pay tomorrow!

The key to the door of fate
Is held by your ways of hate
It will hold better ways to live
When you choose to let it give
If the door slams in your face
Your mind slows down its pace
All the anger, all these things
Make it stop all it brings
Take my hand and follow me
Look and I'll show you what I see
Make a wall and stand in my way
It will come out, this is what I say!
If I had the same door as you
Would I lock it as you do?
Do what you do, Say what you say
Would you live or die where you lay?
When the reflection of anger
Shines back in your eyes
You'll see what happened
Blindly say your good-byes!

Don't know where to go

Caught in between
I can't think right
A solution cant even be seen
You have something to shoot for
Something that I don't
It's what I want most
Get mad? No I won't

What I can or cannot do
Want you with me one day
Next day you don't

All beings are going to die
Pandemonium carries out
Hurry up, scream and shout
Self-destruction is on its way
Don't interfere or you will pay
Hold out for one more day
Or you might end up far away
In the end it is black and grey
There's no one at the end of the day
All you must do is pray
For Self-destruction that is far away

No one to help, no one for my own
Playing mind games with myself
I'm still fighting all alone
It leads to a place
But I do not follow
Straight paths everywhere
No turns from the sorrow
All this is hard enough
But more is thrown at me
You tell me to fight back
Only a reason I can't see
(chorus)
You are like my shadow
But only following at night
During the day
You are out of sight
There's an unknown place
Where things are slow
Life's not so hard
Where negativity is unknown

2873,black-tears,2006,fallacy,Metal,"(J. Hall/K. Holz)
Sleeping in the night it hears a sound
It gets up to take a look around
It finds there's no one there
It falls into a Black tears nightmare
Darkness surrounding, hells breaking loose
Tries to get out but its no use
Faster and faster it starts to turn
Better slow down or it will burn
Schizophrenia passes into the mind
Thinking that it will painfully die
Clasping and grasping for a breath
It learns that it is near death

And stop shutting up
We're all running out of time, waiting in line

All the big war words stop making sense
And you wonder where the money ever got spent
And you wonder how that motherfucker ever got in
This is the part where you get to realize that
Whether your dad died, your boy or your girl lied
There are families on the other side
It's a start, it's the same place for any and all hearts

From the midnight well
For it's dark and evil, so they say
The midnight well
They'll tell you a tale of a lovely young maid
The fairest that they'd ever known
What a beauty, they say
But she went her own way
On that night, she set out on her own
For they say, she had a rendezvous
At the midnight well
With a gypsy man she barely knew
At the midnight well
Nobody knew where he came from
But they remember the fire in his eyes
His earring of gold
And his hair black as coal
And a look that could just hypnotize
When he said
Come away, come away with me
Come here and lay with me
Come away out of the light
Come away, come away
Come and ride with me into the night
Never more, they never saw her face
At the midnight well
She was gone, and never left a trace
At the midnight well
They say when the summer nights come to an end
The harvest moon glows in the sky
A black horse will appear and a sound you will hear
As the ghost of a gypsy flies by
And he says
Come away, come away with me
Come here and lay with me
Come away out of the light
Come away, come away
Come and ride with me into the night
Come away, come away with me
Come here and lay with me
Come away out of the light
Come away, come away
Come and ride with me into the night
Come away, come away with me
Come here and lay with me
Come away out of the light

Do you mind if I sit here down by your graveside,
And rest for a while 'neath the warm summer sun,
I've been walking all day and I'm nearly done.
I see by your gravestone you were only 19,
You joined the great fallin' in 1916.
Well I hope you died quick, and I hope you died clean.
Willy McBride, was it slow and obscene?
[Chorus:]
Did they beat the drums slowly,
Did they play the fife lowly?
Did they sound a death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band play the last post and chorus?
Did the pipes play the flowers of the forest?
Did you leave a wife or a sweetheart behind,
In some faithful heart, is your memory in shrine?
And though you died back in 1916,
In that faithful heart, you're forever 19.
Or are you a stranger without even a name,
Enclosed forever behind a glass pane.
In an old photograph, torn and battered and stained,
And faded to yellow in a brown yellow frame.
[Chorus]
Now Willy McBride, I can't help wondering why
Do those who lie here know why they died.
Did they really believe when they answered the cause,
Did they really believe that this war would end wars?
But the sorrow, the sufferin', the glory, the pain
The killing and dying were all done in vain.
But, Willy McBride, it all happened again, and again, and again, and again, and again.

Did the pipes play the flowers of the forest?"

As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
All the plans that we've made,

And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kiddies knock him down.

Though your nose gets a chilling

Stay with me, sway with me

Only you have the magic technique

That David played, and it pleased the Lord

The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who out drew you
It's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not someone who has seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Is the baddest part of town

You better just beware
Of a man named Leroy Brown
Now Leroy more than trouble
You see he stand about six foot four
All the downtown ladies call him ""Treetop Lover""
All the men just call him ""Sir""

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damned town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog
Now Leroy, he a gambler
And he likes his fancy clothes
And he likes to wave his diamond rings
In front of everybody's nose
He got a custom Continental
He got an Eldorado too
He got a 32 gun in his pocket for fun
He got a razor in his shoe

Now Friday 'bout a week ago
Leroy shootin' dice
And at the edge of the bar
Sat a girl named Doris
And ooh that girl looked nice
Well he cast his eyes upon her
And the trouble soon began
And Leroy Brown learned a lesson 'bout messin'
With the wife of a jealous man

Well the two men took to fighting
And when they pulled them from the floor
Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle
With a couple of pieces gone
And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown

My brother will be there at the door
Like waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Oh, baby, you're so delicious
Well, maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before
I got to get home
Oh baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me a coat
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I'm thrilled when you touch my hand
Why don't you see?
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Making my lifelong sorrow

And the first to cross the threshold of that isle of hope and tears
Was Annie Moore from Ireland who was all of 15 years
Isle of hope, isle of tears
Isle of freedom, isle of fears
But it's not the isle you left behind
That isle of hunger, isle of pain
Isle you'll never see again
But the isle of home is always on your mind
In a little bag, she carried all her past and history
And her dreams for the future in the land of liberty
And courage is the passport when your old world disappears
But there's no future in the past when you're 15 years
Isle of hope, isle of tears
Isle of freedom, isle of fears
But it's not the isle you left behind
That isle of hunger, isle of pain
Isle you'll never see again
But the isle of home is always on your mind
When they closed down Ellis Island in 1943
17 million people had come there for sanctuary
And in springtime when I came here and I stepped onto its piers
I thought of how it must have been when you're 15 years
Isle of hope, isle of tears
Isle of freedom, isle of fears
But it's not the isle you left behind

No, you don't, but I do

Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
""When you comin' home, Dad?""
""I don't know when, but we'll get together then, son

My son turned ten just the other day
He said, ""Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let's play
Can you teach me to throw?"" I said, ""Not today
I got a lot to do"", he said, ""That's ok.""
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed

So much like a man I just had to say
""Son, I'm proud of you. Can you sit for a while?""
He shook his head and said with a smile,
""What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later. Can I have them please?""
Well, the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon

Well, I've long since retired; my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, ""I'd like to see you if you don't mind.""
He said, ""I'd love to, Dad, if I can find the time.
You see, my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad.
It's been sure nice talking to you.""
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me
Well, the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man on the Moon
""When you comin' home, son?""
""I don't know when, but we'll get together then, Dad

2973,maid-of-culmore,2012,celtic-thunder,Pop,"Leaving sweet lovely Derry for fair London town
There is no finer harbor all around can be found
Where the youngsters, each evening, go down to the shore
And the joy bells are ringing for the maid of Culmore
The first time I saw her, she passed me by
And the next time I saw her, she bid me goodbye
But the last time I saw her, it grieved my heart sore
For she sailed down Loch Foyle and away from Culmore
If I had the power: the storms for to rise
I would make the wind blow out and I'd darken the skies
I'd make the wind blow high and the salt seas to roar
'Til the day that my darling sailed away from Culmore
To the back parts of America, my love, I'll go seek
For it's there I know no one and no one knows me
But if I don't find her, I'll return home no more
Like a pilgrim I'll wander for the maid of Culmore"

Not recognizing the kind face

The loving face
Of a mother who can't understand
what she's been guilty of
How she cried, tears of happiness

Now she cries tears of helplessness
and thinks of all the things he can't enjoy

Old men go fishin with black line and spoons.
And, if they catch nothin, they never complain;
I wish I was with them again
2. As boys in their boats call to girls on the shore,
Teasin the ones that they dearly adore.
And, into the evning, the courting begins;
I wish I was with them again.
Chorus:
Can you imagine a piece of the universe
More fit for princes and kings?
Ill trade you ten of your cities for Marion Bridge
And the pleasure it brings.
3. Out on the Mira on soft summer nights,
Bon fires blaze to the childrens delight.
They dance round the flames, singin songs with their friends;
I wish I was with them again.
4. And over the ashes the stories are told
Of witches and werewolves and Oak Island gold.
Stars on the river-face sparkle and spin;
I wish I was with them again. (Chorus)
5. Out on the Mira the people are kind;
They treat you to homebrew and help you unwind.
And, if you come broken, theyll see that you mend;
I wish I was with them again.
6. Now Ill conclude with a wish you go well:
Sweet be your dreamsand your happiness swell.
Ill leave you here, for my journey begins;
Im going to be with them again,
Im going to be with them again."

And I've no doubt
There's truth in what they say
But sure a body is bound to be a dreamer
When all the things he loves are far away
And precious things
Are dreams unto an exile
They take him o'er
The land across the sea
Especially when it happens he's an exile
From that dear lovely Isle of Innisfree
And when the moonlight
Peeps across the rooftops
Of this great city
Wondrous though it be
I scarcely feel its wonder or its laughter
I'm once again back home in Innisfree
I wander o'e r green hills
Through dreamy valleys
And find a peace
No other land could know
I hear the birds make music fit for angels
And watch the rivers laughing as they flow
And then into a humble shack I wander
My dear old home
And tenderly behold
The folks I love
Around the turf fire gathered
On bended knee
Their rosary is told
But dreams don't last
Though dreams are not forgotten
And soon I'm back
To stern reality
But though they pave
The footways here with gold dust
I still would choose
The Isle of Innisfree
I still would choose
The Isle of Innisfree"

Apprentice to trade I was bound
And many an hour sweet happiness
I spent in that neat little town
Till a sad misfortune came over me
Which caused me to stray from this land
Far away from me friends and relations
Betrayed by the black velvet band
I took a stroll with that pretty fair maid
When a gentleman passes me by
I knew that she had the doing in him
By that look in her rovish black eye
A gold watch she took from his pocket
And placed it right into my hand
The very next thing I said was
Bad luck to the black velvet band
Her eyes they shown like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band
Before the judge and the jury
Next morning I had to appear
The judge he said to me
Young lad, your case it is proven clear
We'll go seven years penal servitude
And take you away from this land
Far away from me friends and relations
Betrayed by the black velvet band
Her eyes they shown like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band
So come all ye jolly young fellas
Who warning, take by me
When you are out in the town, me lads
Be aware of them pretty colleens
For they'll feed you with strong drink me lads
Till you are unable to stand
And the very next thing you know is that
You've landed in Van Diemen's land

Where dwelt an fairest colleen, who charmed the hearts of men,
She was winsome hale and hearty, shy and graceful as the dawn,
Neighbours loved that widow's daughter, happy laughing Noreen Bawn.
Till one day there came a letter, with her passage paid to go,
To the land where the Missouri, and the Mississippi flows,
Then she said goodbye to Ireland, and next morning at the door,
That old mother broken hearted, bid farewell to Noreen Bawn.
Many years that mother waited,till one evening at the door,
Stood a gorgeous looking lady, costly were the clothes she wore,
Saying mother dont you know me, for I've only got a cold,
But thoes purple spots upon her cheeks, the tragic story's told."

Home, home, home from the sea
Angels of mercy, answer our plea
And carry us home, home, home from the[ sea
Carry us safely home from the sea.
On a cold winters night
With a storm at its height
The lifeboat answered the call.
They pitched and they tossed
Till we thought they were lost
As we watched from the harbor wall.
Though the night was pitch black,
There was no turning back,
For someone was waiting out there,
But each volunteer
Had to live with his fear
As they joined in a silent prayer.
[Chorus]
As they battled their way
Past the mouth of the bay,
It was blowing like never before.
As they gallantly fought,
Every one of them thought
Of loved ones back on the shore.
Then a flicker of light
And they knew they were right.
There she was on the crest of a wave.
She's an old fishing boat
And she's barely afloat.
Please God, there are souls we can save.
[Chorus]
And back in the town
In a street that runs down
To the sea and the harbor wall,
They'd gathered in pairs
At the foot of the stairs
To wait or the radio call.
And just before dawn
When all hope had gone
Came a hush and a faraway sound.
'Twas the coxswain he roared
All survivors on board
Thank God and we're homeward bound.

Singing ""Just a Song at Twilight""

Now those voices are all silenced, gone before us
Sing me the songs of our gold and silver days
Days filled with innocence and light
Not a penny to our name
We were happy just the same
In our gold and silver days
And we gathered at the Daisy Field
On Sunday after mass
I can hear the songs, the story's and the laughter
Through the years we all were scattered
But the friends we made back then
Were the friends we could rely on ever after

That was as deep as any ocean
But, we get the strength to carry on
And build a life of our own making
We thank the Lord for each new day
And for every breath that we are taking
It's a good life
Far from the high life
And I thank God that this was my life
I've known contentment
In a woman's arms
And felt the warmth of her devotion
And I've known heartache
And a dark despair
That was as deep as any ocean
And looking back on all the years
The loves, the sweetness, and the sorrow
Have made me what I am today
And I'd do it all again tomorrow
It's been a good life
Far from the high life
And I thank God that this was my life
We can't deny life
How it flies by, life
And I thank God that this was my life"
3019,the-dutchman,2011,celtic-thunder,Pop,"The Dutchman's not the kind of man
Who keeps his thumb jammed in the dam
That holds his dreams in,
But that's a secret that only Margaret knows.
When Amsterdam is golden in the summer,
Margaret brings him breakfast,
She believes him.
He thinks the tulips bloom beneath the snow.
He's mad as he can be, but Margaret only sees that sometimes,
Sometimes she sees her unborn children in his eyes.
Let us go to the banks of the ocean
Where the walls rise above the Zuider Zee.
Long ago, I used to be a young man
And dear Margaret remembers that for me.
The Dutchman still wears wooden shoes,
His cap and coat are patched with the love
That Margaret sewed there.
Sometimes he thinks he's still in Rotterdam.
And he watches the tug-boats down canals
An' calls out to them when he thinks he knows the Captain.
Till Margaret comes
To take him home again
Through unforgiving streets that trip him, though she holds his arm,
Sometimes he thinks he's alone and he calls her name.
Let us go to the banks of the ocean
Where the walls rise above the Zuiderzee.
Long ago, I used to be a young man
And dear Margaret remembers that for me.
The winters whirl the windmills 'round
She winds his muffler tighter
And they sit in the kitchen.
Some tea with whiskey keeps away the dew.
And he sees her for a moment, calls her name,
She makes the bed up singing some old love song,
A song Margaret learned
When it was very new.
He hums a line or two, they sing together in the dark.
The Dutchman falls asleep and Margaret blows the candle out.
Let us go to the banks of the ocean
Where the walls rise above the Zuiderzee.
Long ago, I used to be a young man
And dear Margaret remembers that for me."

When you are eighteen,
They say ""Wait, and don't worry"",

When on the world the mists began to fall,
Out of the dreams that rose in happy throng
Low to our hearts Love sang an old sweet song;
And in the dusk where fell the firelight gleam,
Softly it wove itself into our dream.
Just a song a twilight, when the lights are low,
And the flickering shadows softly come and go,
Tho' the heart be weary, sad the day and long,
Still to us at twilight comes Love's old song,
Comes Love's old sweet song.
Even today we hear Love's song of yore,
Deep in our hearts it dwells forevermore.
Footsteps may falter, weary grow the way,
Still we can hear it at the close of day.
So till the end, when life's dim shadows fall,
Love will be found the sweetest song of all."

On the melodies and the high notes ringing,
And the hoot owl cries over everything

Singing in the night time, singing in the day,
When little duck quacks, and he's on his way
And the otter hasn't got much to say
And the porcupine talks to himself

While the honeybee hums and the cricket fiddles,
The donkey brays and the pony neighs
And the old gray badger sighs
Listen to the bass, it's the one on the bottom
Where the bullfrog croaks and the hippopotamus
Moans and groans with a big t'do
And the old cow just goes moo

Some sing low and some sing higher,
Some sing out loud on a telephone wire,
Some just clap their hands, or paws, or anything they've got now

How even through the hard times they were close as close could be
Just like the kindred spirits they will forever be
Now love was as deep as the ocean
Flying higher than the eagles would dare
As strong as the mountains in Donegal
As soft as a morning in Clair

I can hear my father singing as he tucked us into bed.
They shared the love together, they were proud as proud could be
And now those kindred spirits will share eternity."

Remember me, recuerde me. Mi amore.

She went his way homeward with one star awake,
As the swan in the evening moves over the lake.
The people were saying no two were e'er wed
But one has a sorrow that never was said,
And I smiled as she passed with her goods and her gear,
And that was the last that I saw of my dear.
I dreamt last night that my young love came in,
She came in so sweetly, her feet made no din;
She stepped up beside me, and this she did say,
'It will not be long love, till our wedding day."

I'm once again back home in Inisfree
I wander o'er green hills, through dreamy valleys
And find a peace no other land could know
I hear the birds make music fit for angels
And watch the rivers laughing as they flow
And then into a humble shack I wander
My dear old home and tenderly behold
The folks I love around the turf fire gathered
On bended knee their rosary is told
But dreams don't last, though dreams are not forgotten

Left the girls in Tuam, nearly broken hearted,
Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother,
Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother,
Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born
Cut a stout black thorn to banish ghosts and goblin;
Bought a pair of brogues, rattling o'er the bogs
And fright'ning all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin.

Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah!

Started by daylight next morning blithe and early,
Took a drop of pure to keep me heart from sinking;
Thats a Paddy's cure whenever he's on drinking.
See the lassies smile, laughing all the while
At me curious style, 'twould set your heart a bubblin'
Asked me was I hired, wages I required,

To be soon deprived a view of that fine city.

Me bundle it was stole, all in a neat locality.
Something crossed me mind, when I looked behind,
No bundle could I find upon me stick a wobblin'

Wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin.

Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailing.
The Captain at me roared, said that no room had he;
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy.
Down among the pigs, played some hearty rigs,
Danced some hearty jigs, the water round me bubbling;
When off Holyhead I wished meself was dead,
Or better for instead on the rocky road to Dublin.
One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah!

Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it.
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing;
Poor old Erin's Isle they began abusing.
""Hurrah me soul"" says I, me Shillelagh I let fly.
Some Galway boys were by, saw I was a hobble in,

In these last few days, I've been afraid, that I might drift away
I've been tellin' old stories, singing songs
That made me think, about where I've come from
And that's the reason why I seem so far away today.
Let me tell you that I love you
And I think about you all the time
Caledonia you're calling me, now I'm goin' home
But if I should become a stranger
Know that it would make me more than sad
Caledonia's been everything I've ever had.
I have moved, and I've kept on movin'
Proved the points that I needed provin'
I Lost the friends that I needed losin'
Found others on the way
I've kissed the girls and left them crying
Stolen dreams, yes there's no denying
I've traveled hard sometimes with conscience flyin'
Somewhere in the wind
Let me tell you that I love you
And I think about you all the time
Caledonia you're calling me, now I'm goin' home
But if I should become a stranger
Know that it would make me more than sad
Caledonia's been everything I've ever had."

Weve said our last goodbyes

Hes laid to rest
And its now I feel alone
He was more than just my father
My teacher my best friend
He can still be heard
In the tunes we shared
When we play them on my own

I never will forget him
For he made me ""what I am""
Though he may be gone
Memories linger on
And I miss him, the old man
As a boy hed take me walking
By mountain, field and stream
And he'd show me things
Not known to kings
And secret between him and me
Like the colors of the pheasant
As he rises in the dawn
Or how to fish and make a wish
Beside the fairy tree
(chorus)
I never will forget him
For he made me ""what I am""
Though he may be gone
Memories linger on
And I miss him, the old man
I thought hed live forever
He seemed so big and strong
But the minutes fly
And the years roll by
For a father and a son
And suddenly when it happened
There was so much left unsaid
No second chance
To tell him thanks
For everything hed done
(chorus)
Oh, I never will forget him
For he made me ""what I am""
Though he may be gone
Memories linger on
God, I miss him, the old man"

Ride on, see you, I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to
When you ride into the night, without a trace behind
Run your claw along my gut, one last time
I turn to face an empty space, where you used to lie
I look for the spark that lights the night
Through a teardrop in your eye
Ride on, see you, I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to

Every feature needs to be loved from the start
Defend her and shell surrender
Offend her and she will harden her heart
A delicate creature is something she aint, but atake it from me thats a woman
That isnt an angel, that isnt saint, but atake it from me thats woman
She knows how to please and she knows how to play, take it from me thats a woman
Forget to honor love and obey shell take you and break you and throw you away,
Thats a woman, Thats a woman.
She knows every move and knows every trick, take it from me thats a woman
How to kill with a word and cut to the quake(?) take it from me, thats a woman
How to look through you as if youre not there, take it form me thats a woman
How to say no with a flick of her hair, shell turn you and burn you and not even care, Thats a woman, thats a woman
Faithful and true, thats a woman, trusting in you, thats a woman
Gentle and constantly caring, strong as the love she is sharing
When you look in the eyes of a woman (look in here eyes, youll see nothing but lies, thats a woman)
And through the disguise of a woman (every one is the same, shes just playing a game, shes a woman)
Youll see in all there, theres romance in the air
Nothing else can compare, thats a woman.
Woman, so soft and beguiling,
See her smiling, and feel your heart all aglow
Enfold her, lay her head on your shoulder
And hold her till you just cant let her go.
Treat her as if you just dont give a damn, thats how to handle a woman
Be more of a stallion, less of a lamb, thats how to handle a woman
Keep her hanging around till shes ready to burst, thats how to handle a woman
Dont try to be bad, be the worst, do unto others but just do it first
To a woman, to a woman
Be wise, be wary and be on your guard, thats how to handle a woman
If you feel that youre falling, youd better be hard, cause thats how to handle a woman
Dont let her get closer, and dont let her in, thats how to handle a woman
Cuz if you allow her get under your skin, my friend thats the end, cause you aint gonna win
With a woman, with a woman
Look at her body and look at her move, now thats what I call a woman
Im thinking now Ive got something to prove, cause thats what I call a woman
All my moves are stalling here, I cant get through to this woman
The pipes, the pipes are calling here, I think I could be falling here for this woman
What a woman
Faithful and true, thats a woman (She couldnt be true, shes just playing with you, what a woman)
Trusting in you, thats a woman (Trusting in who, you just havent a clue, what a woman
Gentle and constantly caring (Just let it be this ones for me, what a woman)
Strong as the love she is sharing

Why did we ever start?
We're more like strangers now
Each acting out a part
I have laughed, I have cried

Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones that you can't get

Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
And freedom, oh freedom well, that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walking through this world all alone
Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away?
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences, open the gate
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
You better let somebody, before it's too late."

Like a church with no steeple,
Where a bell never rings.
In a town without people,
Where no voice in the choir ever sings.
If a boat on the ocean
Would be lost with no sail,
Then without your devotion
Surely all that I dreamed of would fail.

Hills of forest green where the mountains touch the sky,
A dream come true, I'll live there till I die.
I'm asking you to say my last goodbye.
The love we knew ain't worth another try.
Save me from all the trouble and the pain.
I know I'm weak, but I can't face that girl again.
Tell her the reasons why I can't remain,
Perhaps she'll understand if you tell it to her plain.
But how can words express the feel of sunlight in the morning,
In the hills, away from city strife.
I need a country woman for my wife;
I'm city born, but I love the country life.
For I cannot be part of this cocktail generation:
Partners waltz, devoid of all romance.
The music plays and everyone must dance.
I'm bowing out. I need a second chance.
Save me from all the trouble and the pain.
I know I'm weak, but I can't face that girl again.

In troubled waters, it keeps us afloat
When we started the voyage, there was just me and you
Now, gathered 'round us, we have our own crew
Together we're in this relationship
We built it with care to last the whole trip

Those mighty cedars bleeding in the heat
They're showing pictures on the television
Women and children dying in the street
And we're still at it in our own place
Still trying to reach the future through the past
Still trying to carve tomorrow from a tombstone
But hey, don't listen to me
This wasn't meant to be no sad song
We've heard too much of that before
Right now I only want to be with you
Till the mornin' dew comes fallin'
And I want to take you to the island
Trace your footprints in the sand
And in the evening when the sun goes down
We'll make love to the sound of the ocean
They're raisin' banners over by the markets
White washing slogans on our ship yard walls
Witch doctors praying for a mighty showdown
No way our holy flag is gonna fall
Up here we sacrifice our children
To feed the worn out dreams of yesterday
And teach them dying will lead us into glory
But hey, don't listen to me.
'Cause this wasn't meant to be no sad song
I've sung too much of that before
Right now I only want to be with you
Till the mornin' dew comes fallin'
I want to take you to the island
Trace your footprints in the sand
And in the evening when there's no one around
We'll make love to the sound of the ocean
Now I know us plain folks don't see all the story
And I know this peace and love's just copping out
And I guess these young boys dyin' in the ditches
Is just what being free is all about
And how this twisted wreckage down main street
Will bring us all together in the end
And we'll go marching down the road to freedom

So I just took a hand at this diggin' for gold
But for all that I've found there I might as well be
In the place where the dark Mournes sweep down to the sea
There's beautiful girls here, oh never you mind
Beautiful shapes nature never designed
Lovely complexions of roses and cream
But let me remark with regard to the same
That if at those roses you venture to sip
Colors might fall come away on your lips
So I'll wait for the white rose that's waitin for me

Well sure now he's round here with the rest of the force
I saw him one day as I was crossin the strand
And he stopped the whole street with a wave of his hand
And as we stood talkin of days that are gone
The whole town of London stood there to look on

3080,christmas-1915,2008,celtic-thunder,Pop,"1915 on Christmas Day
On the western front the guns all died away
And lying in the mud on bags of sand
We heard a German sing from no man's land
He had tenor voice so pure and true
The words were strange but every note we knew
Soaring o'er the living dead and damned
A German sang of peace from no man's land
They left their trenches and we left ours
Beneath tin hats the smiles bloomed like wild flowers
With photos cigarettes and pots of wine
We built a soldier's truce on the front line
Their singer was a lad of 21
We begged another song before the dawn
And sitting in the mud and blood and fear
He sang again the song all longed to hear
Silent night, no cannons roar
A King is born of peace for evermore
All's calm, all's bright
All brothers hand in hand
In 19 and 15 in no man's land
And in the morning all the guns boomed in the rain
And we killed them and they killed us again
At night they charged - we fought them hand to hand
And I killed the boy that sang in no man's land
Silent night, no cannons roar
A King is born of peace for evermore
All's calm, all's bright
All brothers hand in hand
And that young soldier sings
And the song of peace still rings
Though the captains and all the kings
Built no man's land
Sleep in heavenly peace."

Losing all perspective,
Can't read between the lines
When will this end?
To see a world that needs the truth
We buried deep inside
When will this end?
We are blind men in a glass prison.
Were not the image that you envisioned.
We are blind men in a glass prison.
Where is your hope? Where is your vision?
Broken lens
Where is your vision?"

My time has come to die
You can't kill me, I'm already dead
This is the martyr's cry

My time has come to die
Death is only the beginning
Of everything I'm living for
This is my final stand
Laid upon the altar
This is my final stand
Laid upon the altar
This is my final stand
Stand up my convictions are not for sale
And I know who I am
They can't deny the truth inside me
So I will suffer at their hands
Dragged through the streets like a criminal
By my own flesh and blood
Guilty by association
There is hell to pay for this apostate son
Kill him, the self-righteous scream
He serves a new king
Kill him, their blind eyes can't see
I serve the true king
Now the rocks start flying
And my mouth it fills with blood
I can hear my mother crying
But one voice is not enough
I was facing the full wrath of hell, feeble as it is
I was facing a good death as well (this is glorious)
Face to face with the grave I was waiting for
And now my killers were
Face to face with a faith they can't ignore
This is my final stand
I will never bow down to your idols
I know who I am
You'll have to put me in the ground to silence me
This is my final stand
You can't kill me, I'm already dead
This is the martyr's cry

Still we don't see them, we look away
Still they cry, but no one is listening
When will we open our eyes
Open our eyes
This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we hear their cries
This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we open our eyes
So let the world listen closely
As I scream to see the freedom they deserve
Let the world listen closely
I say, its time to cross the lines of culture
Birth bringing on poverty
They keep us uninformed and distracted
If they can't fight for themselves, we'll fight for them
Its time to fight the silence (go)
Broken, abused, and exploited
For the sick satisfaction of selfish men
Only a coward would try to ignore it
But we can raise our voice and bring it to an end
Fight, fight, fight the silence
Set the captives free
Fight, fight, fight the silence
They're a slave to a system of apathy
Bought and sold
They're right to life has been taken away
Bought and sold
Bring an end to slavery
Open our eyes
This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we hear their cries
This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we open our eyes
This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we hear their cries
This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we open our eyes
Their fate is in our hands
Will they be left there to suffer
Will somebody take a stand
Against a system that's been designed to deny
Its victims their right to life
Let's set the captives free
When all is said and done, we'll see justice come
Its time to fight the silence (go)
The voice of the voiceless
Fight the silence
We are the hope for the hopeless
Fight the silence
Fight, fight, fight the silence

This is not, this is not how I imagined my life

Don't ask me what is wrong
Because you knew it all along
You say your friends don't understand
They think I'm such an unstable man

Wo, oh, oh, oh
All these pills upon the shelf
One of every kind, I bet I'll find
A cure for being myself

One of every kind, I'm sure to find
A cure for being myself

Personality's gracefully replaced
with the functions of a cupid doll
She cries herself awake, she crawls
And sometimes suffers side effects
from placing burning cigarettes
into her breast until
she's certain that the burning of her flesh is real
Ride
Pull her down the corridor
Tie her muscles to the floor
as she's ravaged by
the queen who never quizzed her there before
Watch her abductor smile and shake
as the rumors start to break
in through the window sill
nothing's really changed but her body's still
Ride yourself away each and every day"

how much I loved you so you thought that I
was only dreaming
What a suprise it must have been
to realise I was one of them
not a game with just the men
not an angel only a friend
and not someone that you could believe in

the dust blows the wind wails
sunbleached skulls and empty shells
broken men with tales to tell

you travel till you can't no more

When you dream a farmer's dream
He could not toe that bottom line
Sometimes I cursed that poor man's pride
Cursed that poor man's pride
Now Daddy was a gambling man
He gambled on tobacco land
Bet your life every spring
To see what harvest time would bring
Could be drought, could be flood
Rolling dice was in his blood
No matter how it all went down
He's just as stubborn as that ground
Money does not mean a thing
When you dream a farmer's dream
He could not toe that bottom line

Broke his back and put him down

So there are things I may have done
I'm not proud of everyone
But everyone is who I am
I'd never take it back again
Wherever I go there I am
Wherever I've been so I've been
I turn around and I grin
I can't change a
Wherever I go there I am
Wherever I've been so I've been
I'll never take it back again
I can't change a
I can't change a thing
Do do do do do do do	(I can't change a in the background vocals until end of song)
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do

I roll with the punches baby, do what I need to do
Enough with the crying, enough with the blame
I'm not a coward, I just don't see any á¹oint to this game
I say it's over, you say it's not
Babe I already know this cause I gave you everything that I got
Or maybe it's you, you, you, yeah you
Or mostly it's me
See I need some time to myself indefinitely
This is my goodbye, woah
I tried to let you down easy
(easy, easy, easy, easy)
This is my goodbye
Oh-oh-oh
No it wasn't easy
(Easy, easy, easy, easy)
Call me a faker, call me a jerk
I'm sorry you're hurting, but there's no way I can make this thing work
I'm not gonna settle, and neither should you
So find someone better, go on, be strong, don't be a fool
I say it's over, you say it's not
Babe I already know this cause I gave you everything that I got
Or maybe it's you, you, you, yeah you
Or mostly it's me
See I need some time to myself indefinitely
This is my goodbye, woah
I tried to let you down easy
(Easy, easy, easy, easy)
This is my goodbye
Oh-oh-oh
No it wasn't easy
It wasn't easy
(Easy, easy)"
3196,live-your-dreams,2010,antoine-clamaran,Electronic,"Who do you follow when you're lost in your dreams
Who do you whisper your sweetest melodies
In the darkness and the moonlight
You're searching for the one
I will take away those memories
'Cause angels like the sun
When you
Live your dreams, live your life
Happiness is now and forever
I want you to know that
You can love you can fly
Don't you know its minor the matter
You know this when you
When there are crumbles
Disappears before your eyes,
The beyond, the emptiness
There's only you and I
I'm the energy and the thunder
That raises through your heart
I'm that everlasting love in you
No matter where you are
When you
Live your dreams, live your life
Happiness is now and forever
I want you to know that
You can love you can fly
Don't you know its minor the matter
You know this when you
Live your dreams, live your life
Happiness is now and forever
I want you to know that
You can love you can fly
Don't you know its minor the matter
You know this when you
You can live, you can love
You can live, you can love
When you
Live your dreams, live your life
Happiness is now and forever
I want you to know that
You can love you can fly
Don't you know its minor the matter
You know this when you
You can live
You can love"
3197,lie-is-its-name,2007,cadaveres-de-tortugas,Metal,"I've got a secret
My love, my parasite
I never gonna tell you
So never ask me why
It's hidden under my skin
This deadly sin of mine
Poison in my body
Pleasure makes me blind
My whole life is pain
Because of this love
It's my punishment
Will never be enough
Lie is its name
Promises are mine
I don't care now
It leaves me as I die
Because of this love
I can't live my life
Because of this love
Can't find the way out"
3198,misgiving-2000,2007,cadaveres-de-tortugas,Metal,"A dream made of plastic
Desire sways me
Death by the central power
Will find you maybe
Torture-awakening
Brain-dead loneliness
Mass drifts with the current
Are they really humen?
I hate this techno-logical belief
I don't wanna talk to answering machines
Mass-loneliness in this age of disease
Why don't you let me hide behind my dreams?
Soul has been left behind
Blind fight into a passion
Sell yourself as a member of the
daily-routine nation"
3199,deadly-dreams-enervates,2007,cadaveres-de-tortugas,Metal,"It woke up in me I asked softly
Leave me alone with a gun on my own
My other self is injected in me
Fatal invention, I had to be
With empty hands, no fear, no pain
Neverending function wounded brain
Infectious creature makes me sleepy
Reality disappears into mistery
The innocent eyes wake me up,
But the deadly dream enervates...
Immobile mutilated bodies
Never will find the forgotten peace
The earth quenches with blood its thirst
Tears on the faces burn and hurt
It's not my blame, I'm innocent
I am a part of a program
Jungle fight rules my mind
Maybe it will be never over
Close to me - Perfectly
I am a - Killing Machine"
3200,indifferent-masses,2007,cadaveres-de-tortugas,Metal,"Deadly silence suggest big storm
Tempests will get their free way soon
Quietness -it's just self- deception
Our world is based on dead conception
Differences get more acute
Future moves off by a blind youth
We're balancing on a blade
Masses are digging their own grave
Don't die by their lies
Don't die by them
Open up your two eyes
While you can
So there's no time to do this blind shit
We're got to do something against it
'cause only the words won't stop the downfall
Stop this process or it burns us all"
3201,eso-es,2007,cadaveres-de-tortugas,Metal,"T me muestras El camino
Un poder autoritativo
Me conduces adelante O me desvias
Mi decisin es la resistencia
La decisin es ma Slo la ma
No te creo La decisin es ma
Quitate de mi vida Se me abren los ojos
Se te acerca el destino Ms y ms ojos abiertos
Eso es
Desesperacin
Tu ley es El poder y el dinero
El dinero te maneja Pero el poder est conmigo
Mi idea, mi esperanza Es la independencia
Mi decisin es la resistencia"
3202,mind-in-cage,2007,cadaveres-de-tortugas,Metal,"The vulgar eyes of a mindless Crime
Are looking at you till the end of time
Your mind is filled with hate
You are your own slave, can't escape
When you're all alone you feel the same old pain
in your brain falls a deadly rain
You have no choice, you've to play game with
The mothafuckin' death is the only exit
To kill somebody
it's not worth the money
To kill somebody
it's not worth the trouble
Lobotomy they are not on your side
Chemical will change your mind
When they get you it means your death
Your freedom is a weapon, don't forget
It was just a minute, the pain lasts forever
The last smile of the death, you won't forget it never
deep in your souls resounds the silent scream
You'll see the dirty blood in your every dream"
3203,diablo-de-luxe,2007,cadaveres-de-tortugas,Metal,"You've got to choose that what side you on, boy
To win or to lose, to build or to destroy
Move on with this muthafuckin' breakdown
Bring down the whole town
if you hear this sound
I'm here again, stronger than ever
Face of an angel, soul of a devil
Learn like a newborn, wise like an old man
Your worse self who just can't be beaten
You can't see me
You can't hear me
You just feel me
Invisible enemy, a shadow that bites
You're so weak with blood in your eyes
This mental pain - an inner shout
A part of your mind but I will get out"
3204,aanima,2007,cadaveres-de-tortugas,Metal,"If you get to know
The deepest feeling
You'll know well what pain means
When it's about real
Inner suffering
That bothers you 'til you're down on
your knees
It hurts to lose someone
But on the day of reckoning
I'll be right if the fire lives on in me
The one who gives me faith
I'm gonna get power
I'm gonna get a friend inside
The one who helps me
To find the right way
The one who surely stands on my side
Beside him in the night
Thousands of souls
Are shining bright
So I cry up to the sky
I cry up to the sky
You lead me
Oh so far away
Hand in hand, entwined
But the road
Came to an end for me
All that dwells in the present time
Overhead,
From the distant sky
I hear you quiet, I see you light
I can go no farther
Just walk alone
To the place where silence borns
Big companion
Yet big solitude
And sorrow is yet more and more
Everything disappears slowly
Well-known faces are greeting me
As I reach the end of my road
At the gates of another world
At the gates of another world"
3205,unsaid,2007,cadaveres-de-tortugas,Metal,"Once we'll meet in a dark-cold room
Where the walls are bloody red
Once I'll be as strong as you
You will feel my breath of death
You'll know my name from a place
You'll remember my face no more
I will ask you something, God
What you'll never let me know
Something
I wanted something more
Anything
I'm so scarred alone
I take from you something and give you
What you'd never ask for
I show you the way you respected
The true faith I was living for"
3206,turtles-ahead,2007,cadaveres-de-tortugas,Metal,"Eh chico, take a look around
Bow down for the CDT sound
Are you fed up? I don't give a fuck
You are the clown of this muthafuckin' town punk
Let's have a late night light flight
Turtles airlines will be your guide
It only has first class, free your mind brother
Sit back, relax with the green smooth devil
Never ever think it's a matter of time
to bring us down - Thanx, we're feelin' fine
Don't have us out of sight, no, but step aside
Don't forget the danger, it's like suicide
Step aside 'cause CDT comes full affect
Yeah let's go ahead
Asi me gusta, no question my brother
These words are strong 'bout the lifestyle I prefer
Always speak the truth in the microphone
I like it like that when our minds are stoned
Sientate - Relajate
Con este agradable verde
Estas harto mio hermano
Apartate - No me paro
I try to fly high, but we're damn I see
I can't stop, I won't stop, hay que pasarlo asi
I don't give a fuck to the things you say
No es tu cosa, I still live my way"
3207,rat-bones,2007,cadaveres-de-tortugas,Metal,"I hear voices coming out of my head
They are my destiny and your dead end
I'm closed into my body, suggest me hate
Souls tied together lost their faith
Voices - loud so loud
Rat bones - in my mind
Voices - Can't drive them back
Rat bones - Deadly blood compact
Rat bones - Under my skin
Rat bones - They kill my dream
Rat bones - Under my skin
Rat bones - It's time to kill
I've dig that bones out for a long time
They're inside me, here in my mind
Crushed splints opened my veins
Affect me and cause me so much pain"

No teria tiempo pora recordar
No teria tiempo pora coher
Solo tengo tiempo pora beber
Vatos logos
Mi problema es de otra genero
Beber y por gue no
Solo despertar tengo cervezas
Y chichas guappas gustan tortugas
Vatos logos"
3210,fuck-the-beaten-track,2007,cadaveres-de-tortugas,Metal,"You smoke the grass and drink a wine
What a feeling but not the way out
Enjoy the life till a limit
Sickness? - Make a think about it!
You don't like the beaten track
But you can be a nervous wreck
'cos you don't know what you want
No, You dont't know what you want
What do you do?
What do you want?
Your life is your private matter
Give a shit what say the others
What will the future bring and why?
In time you will make a decide"
3211,castaway,2007,cadaveres-de-tortugas,Metal,"Vortex motion be my temper
I can feel them coming closer
Cosmic hunters chose their victim
Close to the trap where I am in
Danger for the chaos system
Coming closer I can feel them
Liquid noise sounds so inhuman
Whispering outer space anthem
I'm a castaway
That's not my place to stay
I wanna find my
Home where I'm from
Help me fly away
Starring eyes I can't wait longer
I can feel them coming closer
Increasing light shows when I turn
Open mind - blurred body pattern"
3212,idols-without-regret,2007,cadaveres-de-tortugas,Metal,"In plastic world a new day
You don't wanna see
Its reality you must feel
The taste of the filth
It's in your [dirty] mouth
Deep under your skin
These are broken worms
Try to grasp them
It must burn and hurt & cause that pain
You're lying into the faces
You're smiling in the mirror
You give a faith, an idol
Devices in the hard of the terror
Dirty dignity surface
Just scream of a slave
Just spies in the whole life
Stupid self break
Supplication, imploring hands
There's nothing to help
It isn't worth it
to worry about someone else"
3213,sick-society,2007,cadaveres-de-tortugas,Metal,"I hang down helpless into the water
Impaled to a piece of iron, can't stand it longer
Past 'n' future are the same I've got to forget myself
I count on nobody only on my help
Victim of this goddamn society system
I'm my innocent, but noboby cares 'bout the life of man
And that's what you call as a civilisation
in my opinion it's just the drug of sick nation
Flowin' Time
Timeless Space
Space in Mind
Mindless Race
Just look around in our goddamn world
I think it's the wrong way it has turned
I feel like my brain falls apart in a minute
I've done nothing but I have to suffer for it
Don't you feel yourself guilty for the life of some people
Who sink deeper 'n' deeper while you burn in money fever
Living in this mass it's just less than a wonder
Your fuckin' business why I have to go 6 feet under..."
3214,same-shit,2007,cadaveres-de-tortugas,Metal,"New page - They say it's a new way
Won't change - Rules are all the same
Control - Freedom is a symbol
New fight - Let's get ready to rumble
I don't want the same shit
Without soul
I don't want the same shit
Under control
I don't want the same shit
Without brain
I don't want the same shit
and feel the same pain
Masses - You can be used without a face
Fuck this - Don't be a member of the race
Real life - You are all alone
Stand up - Nothing counts but your own"
3215,escape-song-release-my-demons,2007,cadaveres-de-tortugas,Metal,"If I can't be your friend, I will be your enemy
Try to destroy me, before I destroy you
Try to burn me, yeah, burn me, yeah, burn me, yo
But be aware, my flame can burn you down
It's too late now to hide - Your soul is mine
You know all sins bring forth a brand new sin
Tear my flesh, feed my pain, drink my blood, I don't care
My evil thoughts will haunt you till your last breath
Your scream won't be heard by no one but the inner man
Who slowly addles you and paints your mind red
It's too late now to hide - Your soul is mine and
my revenge needs blood and pain
I release my demons giving you back
All the pain that you caused
It tears me apart, but I don't mind
I can't hold them back anymore
I release my demons and separate
right from wrong, it's my escape song
I release my demons and eliminate
everything, yeah, everything
That holds me back
You can't hold me back
This is my final attack
This is my point of no return, I got no way back
My poisoned mind's ready to spread disease
I'm down to zero. Disillusioned. This is how I feel
But my collapse will destroy my enemies"
3216,floating,2007,cadaveres-de-tortugas,Metal,"My body sinks through thick-mud
I wanna grasp something but just cannot
I fell my end and I see myself dead
While the waves dask-over my head
Gasp for breath, sink deeper -n- deeper
The light glimmers hardly and much more paler
My body grows weary, I don't feel pain
Every trouble seems to be far away
Life before my eyes
No one can tell me lies
I will see the secret
The question: Is it the beginning or is it the end?
The press of the mud is embrace now
I don't wanna be back and don't know how
I lost the sight of light, I can't see the surface
My new home is the restfull space"
3217,follow-me-down,2007,cadaveres-de-tortugas,Metal,"Now I can see they're not any better
Their lies give 'em some more chances
Lil' more time but can't play with fate
It's too late to hide from my hate
I know what will be my weapon
I use yours: that goddamn silence
Now I arm myself and I turn
Against you in your perfect world
I empower from down under
Tear the ancient instincts open
They are leading me through my life
I feed myself through my roots
My pain was only a lesson
Learned who I really can count on
This taught me how to live my life
Overcome myself to survive"
3218,symbol-of-silence,2007,cadaveres-de-tortugas,Metal,"My voice echoes. It fills the town
Searching for you, who can't be found
I close my eyes and sleep. I feel you again
I'm burning inside, my fever's rising high
Till the dawn does us apart
I want to find that place
Tell me which road leads me to you?
I only need a little sign
And I'll wander to find you
Until the end of time
Sun dries the tears I wept
Embrace my wheezin' breast
I don't want to lose my faith in you
I want to get out of here. The prison of oblivion
Say goodbye, 'cause night is calling
And I'm ready to pass away
In the cradle of night
My cleansed soul sleeps
Its smile is true again
Its quiet moan is relieved
There's patience all around
Confusion's left behind
If you need a sign I'm fine:
Just look up to the sky
I painted it there
I hid it there
I draw it there
The symbol of silence"
3219,password-showdown,2007,cadaveres-de-tortugas,Metal,"Closer, one step closer
One step closer to me
Show yourself, your real face
It's time to clear who'd you be
I wanna know what can you say
Reasons are what I wanna hear
Speak about you, about your life
That relegated me
Away, go to hell away
Don't wanna control me
You try to make me blind
But you lie to me I see
I got truth on my side
And I do what I like
That's all I can say
Go to hell away
Don't wanna judge me
Don't judge me
Don't wanna bind me
I can't live that way
Closer, one step closer
Try to tell some more
You can't... than give up my friend
That's the only solution I know"
3220,aflame-spark-of-life,2007,cadaveres-de-tortugas,Metal,"Nobody knows who I am behind this mask of mine
I don't wanna hear you askin' me you will never know
The fire that burned you through my eyes has you
Under control and won't ever let you go
Everyone feels it's in the air yeah you can feel the vibe
You don't need to ask me about it - Take a look around
A new breed so strange prepares to rearrange your life
You are stuck in the past but now your future is mine
Nobody knows it
But everyone feels it
You gotta kill me 'cause
I'll never let you break me
It burns and it burns and it's light turns me on
This time I won't let it out of my world
I'd rather be burnt, than to be frozen
Set my soul on fire - Set me free
Nobody knows what's that growin' under the skin of mine
I don't wanna hear you askin' me you will never know
It wants to get out, come to life, help you to reach your goal
You'll never be the same anymore
Everyone feels it's in the air yeah you can feel the vibe
You don't need to ask me about it - Take a look around
Hide the light in your eyes - The spark of life will
Burn the world as it will explode in my mind"

Solo tengo un camino, la libertad
It seems like I got no voice, can you hear me?
Listen to me
It seems like I can't be heard, are you with me?
Listen to me
Never step back, never look back
It's your decision
Look at your life, are you still alive?
It's revolution
Never give up, never give in
I'm never gonna give it up again
I see in your eyes: you all wanna rise
You ought to better
Forget the lies, throw off all disguise
Do you remember
You are the boys who started the noise
I wanna hear you!
Never resign, don't say you don't mind
It's all up to you
Can't stop, all we want is our tomorrow
This time, the only thing you gotta do is to follow
And our dream will be real
I hate what I see but I gotta see
The fake smile of a king for a day
I'm sorry to say but I don't wanna play this game
A fight for the fame, it's gone too far
We're the sound from the underground
That's who we are"
3222,panic-tech,2007,cadaveres-de-tortugas,Metal,"You don't refuse the new ideas
But close them into a ghetto
Put chains to the open-minded
Give free way to the terror
Mechanical humanoid nation
Is the solution to your problems
Kill my soul, kill my mind, kill my
Feelings to stop my resistance
I'm not a part of your program
I'm gonna be the error in the system
I won't be a part of your program
I'm gonna be the error in the system
Machines won't fight against you
More technology than human
Put gun in the hand of killers
They want fight so show them where they can"
3223,absolvation,2007,cadaveres-de-tortugas,Metal,"It's a different day, your time has come
The lying interests betray you
Don't think about revenge, forget it
There's nothing you could do
Your way has been written
Have patience in silence
Believe in the power of faith
Wear your crown of violence
Rusty nails through your flesh
Endless gate in the plane
Into the immortality
Will we rise again?
Don't you feel fear? They expel you
in the protection of innocents
Suffer for our sins, your body cries blood
The torture never ends"
3224,salvo-karma,2007,cadaveres-de-tortugas,Metal,"I'm the slave of my past
More and more
Life never gonna be
Like was before
I can't digest
What I have seen
Silence inside
Makes me scream
Hold me please
Into your arms
My damn journey
It only starts
I'm too weak
to stop this painflow
Take my body
and let me go
Voice - comes from above
Noise - rips my head off
A sign - brings me bow down
Lights - go out in me
I'm blind to see:
You come near to me
My brain falls asleep
To a dream so deep
I feel your breath
Burns on my skin
I'm tired of this fight
Where no one wins"

I am turned to my real self
I know my fate
My fate is what I accept
The imminent end,
Trust in the eternal faith
It made me who I am
I don't fear to pass away
I don't need your laws anymore
I write the rules of my game
Driven by my instincts
I'll always find the straight way
Ask me: who am I?
Look me in the eye
It won't tell a lie
My life - that's all I've got
My fate - is in my blood
Sometimes it lets me left behind
Sometimes it makes from us a tribe
In my skin
You can see: my past is scratched
To face the fear
My rebell pride always helped
You let your envy
Turn to hate and control you
It will ruin everything
That's what it will do
Your fucked up life turns you against me
But we've got the same blood in our veins
Would I be different? Less than you?
No, we are the same"

You have sold your soul
You don't need a word to say
DON'T NEED AT ALL!
I don't need you to like me
DON'T NEED AT ALL!
I don't need you to search for me
And take my hand no more

You have sold your soul
You don't need a word to say
DON'T NEED AT ALL!
I don't need you to feel regret

You've never spoken about
I thought I'm a part of your world
Why did you shut me out?
Promises full of pleasures
Why did you steal the light?
Let the rain wash away
the memories that hurt inside
My revenge will take you over
Taste my pain
First I ran from you
Now I slow down
You can get me but can't get over me
I show you what you've denied"
3228,wardance,2007,cadaveres-de-tortugas,Metal,"My question is simple: with me or versus me
My body's with me - my soul is my enemy

As evil and good collide in my mind
Closed in a circle like blood in vein
I can't runaway and it makes me insane
Pain in my lying sins
Fear in my true belief
There's a forever storm inside
Let me go or my soul tears apart
I'm divided into wrong and right
I hate this fight I lose my mind
I'm only a tool (of life)
In the hand of destiny
I personify (its plans)
He'll kill me as he'll be ready
I play - you dance
You play - I dance
He plays - we all dance
You can't get - I can't get
We can't get out of control
On the last page in the book of life
I dance with you whose face is mine
Dead souls invite us for guests
On their faces there is blood and rest
Closed in a circle like blood in vein
I can't runaway and it makes me insane
Inside me thousands of demons
They don't let me rest in peace
I'm divided into wrong and right
I hate this fight I lose my mind
Drag me left and right, they mangle me
Please set me free, they're killing me"

To another dimension, to the unknown
In trap forever - The nation of fear
Meeting with the other - Fear of my dream
They have my body - world of my fear
I've got their body - Deep inside me

Below me terrible depth, I fly so high
I can't escape, I see a neverending way
Who's walking on the darkside of my brain

To wait for the silence, to lie without respects
I know, once the things will be clear

It's the color of the grass in spring
Or the stars against a moonless sky
When two bodies move as one
When two lovers groove on
You can be what you want to be
You can be most anything
Feel the rhythm
Now I have travelled far
To build a bridge between us, oh-oh
And I will linger on...to find the colors in your rainbow
You turn me on...your tear me up
You tear me up...you turn me on
You turn me on...you set me up
You set me up...you turn me on"

What's it take for you to see the man in me

Anyday - and leave the past behind
Anyday - I'll say bye bye
Anyday - and leave you to your own
But each and every time you say ""I'm sorry""
Girl you know I try my best to believe it's true
But what then would you expect now babe
From a poor lonely boy who's so strung out on you
Lord only knows I tried a thousand times before
Someday soon I'm gonna walk right out that door
Anyday - I'll pack my bags on you

of moonlight and brandy, sweet talk and candy

Memories of the year that lays behind us
wishes for the year that's yet to come

make you feel that life has just begun

I do my work, ain't enough anymore
It takes the mornin' after to forget the night before
Too daze gone, too daze gone
I'm broke down, insufferable, my mind is on the blink
It's later than you think and I'm too daze gone
Went to see a friend just the other day (grovin')
Had a drink or two and we blew the night away (grovin')
Takin' in another show, how we live I'll never know
I can't remember the things that we said
Now all I got is this achin' in my head
Too daze gone, too daze gone
I'm broke down, insufferable, my mind is on the blink
It's later than you think and I'm too daze gone
Gone through the games that you want me to play
Gone past the rules that you put in my way
Racin' past your limit, ain't no right and wrong
Past the point of carin', too daze gone,uh, yeah, yeah
Couldn't raise my head just to save the day (loosin')
I do my penance, try to keep the world at bay (loosin')
Outta sight, outta mind, ills you don't expect to find
I learned my lesson a thousand times too
Don't make no impression, one thing I can do
Too daze gone
Too daze gone

Too daze gone
Too daze gone (talk about it)

I relinquish my doubts at the sound of your name
I can feel your desire when I walk through that door

Would you take me in, are you lonely in the dark

You never listen to the voices inside
They fill your ears as you run to a place to hide

Can you make a play, will you meet me in the dark

Full of plans but not much knowin'
Tried my hand at the game of love
But I was so naive
From the shelter of mama's wings
Learned to fly but I was broken
By a woman of 25
When I was just 19
Didn't know where to find myself
The rules they were not so simple
Makes no sense tryin' to face this world
'til you're old enough to fight
Lover...you're the reason I'll be home tonite
Lover...never thought that I would see the light
I was hungry in '81
For a time I thought I'd found her
Found myself on the road again
Freezin' from the cold
Fortune found me in '82
With a girl from way down under
She seemed like the natural thing
I thought I knew for sure
Tried to hold her--I could not see
Past her eyes was a spell unbroken
Battered visions and frozen dreams
That would never see the light...now you're my
Lover...you're the reason I'll be home tonite
Lover...someone told me it comes once-in-a-lifetime
Lover...never thought that I would see the light
Lover...you're the reason I'll be home tonite
It's a long road to salvation
People say nothin' lasts forever
But when it comes to the bottom line
When I make it I'll see you there...see you there
Once in a lifetime...
Now we're lookin' on better times
It seems like a miracle
But I'll never forget those days
I'm ready now to fight...for you my

Scarred romances...cast away

Chase the spirit you can't control
The inner notions 're takin' hold
Listen to the heartbeat
I remember those cold cold nights...we'd stay up all night long
I can remember you holdin' out...and I'd be holdin' on
You can put out my fire
You can stir up my one desire
You can make me wonder how we could ever shy away

Who seemed pretty normal on sight
Wantin' for nothin'...but wantin' for somethin'
But mama made everything right
Inside her protection he learned of rejection
By a world that was not quite his own
He took his reward in a double-edged sword
Now the poor boy is always alone
He built himself a time-bomb

A walking, talking time-bomb

A young girl waits by the phone
Longin' for daddy...she's missin' him badly
She knows that he's not comin' home
So down by the levee...her heart weighin' heavy
She knows that she's got to break free
She falls when she sees him...she knows how to please him
They can't see the woods for the trees
She built herself a time-bomb
A walking, talking time-bomb
It's about to explode under me
She's sittin' on a time-bomb
A ticking, talking time-bomb
It's about to explode under me
You gotta have faith late into the night
If there's another day...try to make it right
Find another way...shine another light
So now they're both older...their world growin' colder
And nothin' appears as it seemed
They look to their future...and the wounds that they nurture
And try to hold on to their dreams
This terrible twosome have really been through some
Scenes that they both know by heart
Mem'ries that jail them...support that has failed them
And they laugh but it tears them apart
We're sittin' on a time-bomb

Stickin' to the rhythm of the music in my head
Rockin' in the mirror, rollin' out the door
Hop into the car and put the pedal to the floor
Callin' out your number, I'll take you for a ride
Find something to keep me satisfied
Runnin' for the money, layin' out the green
It's a tax accountant's nightmare, it's a rock n' roll dream
The income may be different but the outcome's still the same
You'll never be a winner boy until you play the game
Hounded to distraction, racin' to and fro
Losin' my direction keepin' up my status quo
Now I tried, tried, tried, tried
It just don't seem to keep me satisfied
A hundred thousand miles in a 747
Take it all in style if you wanna get to heaven
Chasin' all the action every single night
Never understand it but you try to do it right
Ragged 'round the edges, none the worse for wear
Cuttin' all the corners but they never get me there
Now I try, try, try, try
It just don't seem to keep me satisfied"

Work for your girl--work hard to relieve her

Everyday you fight with your job
Fight with your lover hold back the mob
Run for your cover

Put all your guns away
Turn out the light--reach out, now let me know
It all works out-oh yea

Wakin' up from a fantasy

Where you can run, but you just can't hide
'til one fine day I pushed my fears aside

Lovin' you ain't so hard
Turn on your light...now I won't go far

Sometimes...it's so hard to let go
Many times I tried to walk away
Listened long to what my friends would say
Only to find out at the end of the day
They'd taken me just so far
No more wanderin'...i'm almost home
Only a fool would walk this earth alone
When he could have your smile to call his own

Lovin' you ain't so hard
Turn off your light...now I won't get far

Is this the shape of better things to come
I'm frightened for the future
I can feel no pulse inside your mind-machine
I can feel no pulse...you stripped my senses clean
I can feel no pulse...inside your mind-machine
I can feel no pulse...you broke my mind-machine
Inside your world it's cold and blue as ice
Where no one speaks and no one need reply
To questions that I've asked a thousand times
No answer to the riddles that you keep

Your fancy dinners in the restaurants

You show your bad side
It's so undignified
Get off your back side

Go and be what you wanna be

Avoid the contradictions--just keep yourself alive

Polite conversation ain't no consolation

Get around town, spend your time on the run
You never let down, say you do it for fun
Never miss a play, though you make quite a few
You give it all away when everybody wants you
You crave attention, you can never say ""no""
Throw your affections anyway the wind blows
You always make it, you're on top of the scene
You sell the copy like the cover of a magazine
Putting on the eyes till there's nobody else
You never realize what you do to yourself
The things that they see make the daily reviews
You never get free when everybody wants you
Everybody knows you
Everybody snows you
Everybody needs you, leads you, bleeds you
Nights of confusion and impossible dreams
Days at the mirror, patching up around the seams
You got your glory, you paid for it all
You take your pension in loneliness and alcohol
Say goodbye to conventional ways
You can't escape the hours, you lose track of the days
The more you understand, seems the more like you do
You never get away, everybody wants you"
3348,love-is-the-hero,2006,billy-squier,Rock,"There is a course in life, so all the teachers say
It calls you day and night, it takes your thoughts away
Under a frozen light you face a long crusade
Where there's a cause you fight, where there's a cost you pay
Find an empty heart, you feel the passion play
It's when reactions start that you can't look away
There is no wrong or right, there's just your point of view
But when you face the light then it will come to you
Love is the hero, soldier forever
Life below zero, never say never
There is no sacrifice, there is no dead-end street
There is no sound advice, only the watch you keep
With every step you take through every room of fear
With every move you make the song will pull you near
Turn you world around and it will come your way
Through your cold-chill nights and in your hard-earned days
When you face the light it may be hard to do
But when it's all too right then it will come to you
Love is the hero, soldier forever
Love is the hero, you live to remember
No path is too steep, no distance too wide
No question too deep, no force can divide
You fortune you seek, the road will unwind
You're comin' to me, to search is to find
And when you start to fall into that frozen space
And when you reach the wall and there's no sunny place
And when it all comes down you make it anyhow, anyway
Love is the hero"

I don't know why...
She cast my life in shame
But everytime she walk I seem to fall down on my honor

Hey!...the girl's all right
She's got rhythm...steers me when I roll
Hey!...the girl's all right

Does she ever hear me at all
Everyday there's somethin' that she wants
Tells me things that I can't recall
Nails me down--she's a hammer
Can't see no way out
Of all the ways you can run these days--you can't out-run the mouth
I don't know why
At times she can go on
But if by chance we meet I know
With her it won't be wrong
She's got rhythm...rocks me to my soul
Hey!...the girl's all right
She's got rhythm...scares me, then I know
Hey!...the girl's all right
Sometimes I fail to notice...sometimes I play too rough
But when I feel I'm losin' her
Well then I've had enough
Knows my limitations...and she always calls my bluff
I take back what I said tonight

Would you take me in, are you lonely in the dark

Can you make a play, will you meet me in the dark

You make the rounds and you try to be so sincere
You guard your hopes and you pocket your dreams
You'd trade it all to avoid an unpleasant scene

Call it what you like it's time you got to win

Get the dynamite, the boys are set to howl

Are you ready for a fight, do you wanna take it all?
Slowdown, showdown waitin' on line
Show time, no time for changin' your mind
Streets are ringin', march to the sound
Let your secrets follow you down
Somebody's watchin' you baby, so much you can do
Nobody's stoppin' you baby, from makin' it too
One glimpse'll show you now baby, what the music can do
One kiss'll show you now baby, it can happen to you
No more sleepin', wastin' our time
Midnight creepin's, first on our minds

And I find myself holdinï¿½ on to nothinï¿½ more than a dream...
And it keeps hauntinï¿½ me...over and over and over again...
In a darkened sky of blue Iï¿½m thinkinï¿½ of you...
As the pieces come unglued Iï¿½m reachinï¿½ for you...
Love can change the days in your life
Heartbeats and whispers in the dead of night
The sound of a hand--the touch of an eye
Visions are callinï¿½ that you canï¿½t deny
And I fall for love...
So every day Iï¿½m out on the streets tryinï¿½ to make some sense of
It...
You know sometimes it feels so close that I can almost reach
Out...
But it always slips away...
I keep tellinï¿½ myself...""I canï¿½t stop tryinï¿½...not
Ever""...
ï¿½til I see that dream come true baby with you...
If itï¿½s the final thing I do Iï¿½m waitinï¿½ for you...
Loneliness and love will collide
The bodyï¿½s breakinï¿½ but the spiritï¿½s alive
And just when you think itï¿½s all been a lie

If you would look my way

One castle keep, one will decide
It's not right
For every heart there burns a flame
To light the soul and make you one again
In every heart there looms a voice
We'll have our day, oh yeah
I lived a lie bound from my birth
I need to find what life is worth
It's not mine
Oh secret soul that burns inside
No forced control can make you hide
Open wide
A restless heart who needs a friend
To free my soul and make me one again
Within my heart I found a voice
I'll have my say
For every heary there burns a flame
To light the soul and make you one again
In every heary there looms a voice

And again and again and again

Distrarsi sembrava piuttosto facile
Credevo di sopportare la tua indifferenza
Cercando pretesti e rimedi inutili
Eri tu quel tasto dolente eri tu autunno dolciastro eri tu
Freddamente valutavo I miei limiti
I gesti avventati le frequenti rinunce
Era tardi e bruciavano gli occhi fissavo il soffitto
Il mio letto disfatto
Quasi speravo che non arrivassi piu'
Quasi credevo che non mi mancassi eppure stavo aspettando

That my world is sinking
Because all of my wounds
I will feel them soon
So I never face it
I try to erase it

Alone with my thoughts
Forced to remember
What I forgot
No one to call
My mistakes
And me
Or the only ones awake - away - Away!

3491,is-love-enough,2007,george-duke,Jazz,"featuring Rachelle Ferrell, Lori Perry, Jim Gilstrap
Is love enough to keep you satisfied
Or has it turned kinda bleak
Is love enough to keep you comin' home
Every single day of the week
Is love enough to keep your groove on
Or do you have to mess around
Is love enough to keep your right from wrong
And keep your butt from all over town
Oh, is love enough
Is love enough, somebody asked me one day
I said I had to think to myself
Give me two days and I'll come back around
And tell you what I have to say
You know I thought, I dreamed, I fought and I prayed
What will be the answer that I seek
And the answer that I'm looking for
Just may not be the one I need
Oh, is love enough
Is love enough to make me do the do
Help me to do the things that I say
Is love enough to make me walk the walk
And walk the talk I speak everyday
Is love enough to make me stay real
And keep me from being phony to you
Is love enough to stand in front of a bus
And take the hit for you if that's what must be
Is love enough"
3492,how-about-you,2007,george-duke,Jazz,"How about you?
Will you see this through?
How about you?
Will you be strong or am I wrong?
Have I stayed too long
And sung the wrong song, oh baby
Come home too late, put you in a state
That you can't see your way through
Oh, how about you?
Will you even try not to deny
That that is right with us
Baby hold on, before it's gone, oh
How about you, baby?
Do you say we're through?
Oh, how about you?
Have you moved on, found a new song?
Oh, how about you?
Should we start anew?
Won't you answer me please? I'm down on my knees
Beggin' you to make your move
Do you feel the same or am I insane?
Blinded by cold-hearted love
Is this a game, that both of us lose?
Baby, please, please choose
How about you?
Do you feel like I do?
How about you
How about you?
This tango's for two
Oh, how about you?
Will you even try not to deny
That, that is right with us
Or am I insane
Blinded by cold-hearted love
Is this a game, that both of us lose?
Come on, just choose
How about you, baby?
I want to see this through
Now it's up to you, decide what you'll do
Before it's too late
How about us
How about us"

Waiting on this laid back Sunday with you
All week long a mid-summer dream
Promises a laid back Sunday with you
Oh, my love
Such precious time with you
Walkin', talkin', holdin' hands
Lovin' this laid back Sunday with you
Smiles across a cool summer glass
Sharing this laid back Sunday with you
Waiting so long
To spend this day with you
Window shopping down at the mall
Groovin' on this laid back Sunday with you
Checking out the band on the town
Diggin' this laid back Sunday with you"

The sunday evenings, the fun we use to share
Looking through the memories in my mind
Since I've laughed and cried and thought it over
Now I realize that it's never over only set aside
chorus:
Oh it's you sweet baby
I will never be free from your embrace
Sweet baby
Only hopin' it's not too late to try again
It's you sweet baby
Ever always been captured by your smile, sweet baby
I will always be right there by your side
Right by your side
2. Lyin' here alone I'm dreamin'
My mind keeps wanderin' why
My thoughts are only you
Wanderin' through the memories in myy mind
How could love so real have gone so empty
I just keep wanderin' why
Well I ever find the love we share
3. Oh it's you sweet baby
Though we've had such a long hard road to climb, sweet baby
Only hopin' it's not too late to try again
It's you, sweet baby
Won't you try and believe in what I say, sweet baby
I will always be right there by your sided, right by your side

3496,love-songs,2007,george-duke,Jazz,"Love songs, sweet love songs
Love songs, sweet, sweet, sweet love
Hasn't every way to write a love song been written
And hasn't every way to tell the story been told
Hasn't everyone been moved and soothed by the melodies
Aren't there other tales to be told, other stories to unfold
Haven't we anything else to say
Or are we merely trapped to find another way
To say the same things
Don't we have other thoughts, other dreams
Girl it seems every time I search that quiet place
I find myself with you face to face
In my mind there's nothing left to say except, ""I love you""
Love songs, sweet love songs
(I love you)
Hasn't every way to sing a love song been sung
And hasn't every way to phrase the message been done
Haven't all the great ones sung the melodies that've wooed you
And aren't there other songs to be sung with messages untold
Seems that we've lost our will to challenge the mind
And be a unique kind of art it's been for me
Oh a teacher or prophet by pen
Girl but wait, don't get me wrong, I love a good good love song
One that gets me real good, when I close my eyes
I only seem to find the words ""I love you""
""I love you"", girl I can't help myself
(Love songs, sweet love songs)
And as long as you keep needin' them
I'll keep servin' 'em till my last breath
(Love songs, sweet, sweet, sweet love)
No, I'm not alone, there're others like you and me
'Cause there's always someone who wants
To tell their story of need
It's a simple story, one as old as time
(Love songs, sweet love songs)
And we all know that sometimes
Love don't have no reason or rhyme
(Love songs, sweet, sweet, sweet love)
Hingin' on to those love songs
Oh love, oh love, oh love
Love songs, sweet love songs"
3497,thinkin-bout-you,2007,george-duke,Jazz,"Though we push this feeling aside
And though we cry, this can't go on forever
Seasons come and seasons flow and I know
That most things come to an end
But you're so wonderful
Good for me in every way
And I love that message you left on my
Service today
""Oh, boy I'm thinkin' 'bout you""
Girl, I'm thinkin' about you, too
You've become so special, someone I don't
Want to lose
""Baby boy I'm thinkin' 'bout you, your love""
I need you in my life
Sometimes the simple things are the best
Things to say
And sometimes it's what you least expect
That will make your day
And sometimes it's not words at all but a
Glance saying ""I'm okay""
Sometimes a simple ""Hi, it's me"" will set
You on your way
Like a warm breeze
A memory that stays in your head
One that feels so good you'll wish you could
Live it instead
""Oh, boy I'm thinkin' 'bout you""
Girl, I'm dreamin' about you, too
You're so special, someone, the only one
I choose
""Baby boy I'm thinkin' 'bout you, your love""
I need you in my life
Never say no, 'cause what you won't do
You do for love, no matter what they say
You'll swallow your pride
Reach down deep inside
And find what is true and what's real
Baby, oh I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Yes, I'm thinkin' 'bout you, your love
I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Baby, oh I'm thinkin' 'bout you, your love"

Never serve ya till it's time
We will supply the heat
Good things from head to feet
We will be your rock
And when you're really in need
Turn it to the right and feel the flow
And if you want some more
Just look down, we're kinda low
We will be your rock
Just when you need to be found
We'll be right back on the block
Right back on the block, right back
You know we'll be around
Say you been lost in a barren land
With no water or funk on hand
Hot sweat runs down your chin
Look what a mess you're in
Put your hands upon the rock
(Let the vibes flow through)
Then check the time on your clock
(As if it really knew)
Turn on your radio, big daddy's flowin' so
Pump up the volume it's kinda low"

Self respect and the will to rise above
Whatever happened to the right thing to do
Love your brother, let peace abide with you
Whatever happened to live and let live
Tolerance and a willingness to give
Whatever happened to the goodness in a man
Was good ever there or has good lost its hand
Whatever happened to the drive to learn
To better oneself just because one yearns
Whatever happened to the unique voice
The one of a kind giving us a greater choice
Whatever happened to striving towards goals
Seems we're our own worst enemy and foe"

Everyone on the line, no other way to choose

Master's plan
We can do it if we try
And if others ask you why say
It's our world
Far too many just don't care, a living negative
It's our world
And we know right and wrong
But far too many close their eyes and hide
Their fears at home
It's our world
And we must keep our love alive
We've done so much and come so far
But yet we still can't get along and don't
Know who we are
War and pain, I read somewhere
Said they will always be with us until He comes again
Does that mean we shouldn't try
Should I just lay on down and die
Our world
Only world
It's our world, it's a gift
(Celebrate life) we can find a better way
We can change it (rearrange it)
And there's really nothing else to say
It's our world, just keep it goin', do it
It's our world, we better try, honey
It's our world, just show your love
It's our world, don't let it get you down
Keep it goin', just keep it goin', do it
It's our world, we can do it

It's our world, take care"

Am I so betrayed
